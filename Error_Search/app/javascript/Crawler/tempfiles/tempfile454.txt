JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Polymorphism in JavaDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 14 Dec, 2021The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. Real-life Illustration: PolymorphismA person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.Types of polymorphismIn Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: Compile-time PolymorphismRuntime PolymorphismType 1: Compile-time polymorphismIt is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. Note: But Java doesn’t support the Operator Overloading.Method Overloading: When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by change in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.Example 1 Java// Java Program for Method overloading// By using Different Types of Arguments // Class 1// Helper classclass Helper { // Method with 2 integer parameters static int Multiply(int a, int b) { // Returns product of integer numbers return a * b; } // Method 2 // With same name but with 2 double parameters static double Multiply(double a, double b) { // Returns product of double numbers return a * b; }} // Class 2// Main classclass GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Calling method by passing // input as in arguments System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(2, 4)); System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(5.5, 6.3)); }}Output: 8 34.65 Example 2Java// Java program for Method Overloading// by Using Different Numbers of Arguments // Class 1// Helper classclass Helper { // Method 1 // Multiplication of 2 numbers static int Multiply(int a, int b) { // Return product return a * b; } // Method 2 // // Multiplication of 3 numbers static int Multiply(int a, int b, int c) { // Return product return a * b * c; }} // Class 2// Main classclass GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Calling method by passing // input as in arguments System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(2, 4)); System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(2, 7, 3)); }}Output: 8 42 Type 2: Runtime polymorphismIt is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.ExampleJava// Java Program for Method Overriding // Class 1// Helper classclass Parent { // Method of parent class void Print() { // Print statement System.out.println("parent class"); }} // Class 2// Helper classclass subclass1 extends Parent { // Method void Print() { System.out.println("subclass1"); }} // Class 3// Helper classclass subclass2 extends Parent { // Method void Print() { // Print statement System.out.println("subclass2"); }} // Class 4// Main classclass GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Creating object of class 1 Parent a; // Now we will be calling print methods // inside main() method a = new subclass1(); a.Print(); a = new subclass2(); a.Print(); }}Output: subclass1 subclass2 Output explanation: Here in this program, When an object of child class is created, then the method inside the child class is called. This is because The method in the parent class is overridden by the child class. Since The method is overridden, This method has more priority than the parent method inside the child class. So, the body inside the child class is executed.Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.
