The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.Topics :IntroductionImplementationStandard ProblemsOperations on QueueMiscQuick LinksIntroduction :QueueApplications of Queue Data StructurePriority QueueApplications of Priority QueueDequeCircular QueueQueue Interface In JavaQueue In PythonQueue In C#Implementation :Implement Queue using StacksLRU Cache ImplementationImplement Stack using QueuesQueue | Set 2 (Linked List Implementation)How to efficiently implement k Queues in a single array?Implement a stack using single queueImplementation of Deque using circular arrayCircular Queue | Set 2 (Circular Linked List Implementation)Implement Stack and Queue using DequePriority Queue using Linked ListPriority Queue using doubly linked listImplementation of Deque using doubly linked listStandard Problems :Check if a queue can be sorted into another queue using a stackBreadth First Traversal or BFS for a GraphLevel Order Tree TraversalReverse a path in BST using queueConstruct Complete Binary Tree from its Linked List RepresentationProgram for Page Replacement Algorithms | Set 2 (FIFO)Check whether a given Binary Tree is Complete or not | Set 1 (Iterative Solution)Number of siblings of a given Node in n-ary TreeZigZag Tree TraversalFIFO (First-In-First-Out) approach in ProgrammingFIFO vs LIFO approach in ProgrammingLIFO (Last-In-First-Out) approach in ProgrammingOperations on Queue :Reversing a QueueReversing a queue using recursionReversing the first K elements of a QueueInterleave the first half of the queue with second halfSorting a Queue without extra spaceMisc :Level order traversal in spiral formSliding Window Maximum (Maximum of all subarrays of size k)Find the largest multiple of 3 | Set 1 (Using Queue)Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumpsSmallest multiple of a given number made of digits 0 and 9 onlyIterative Method to find Height of Binary TreeImplement PriorityQueue through Comparator in JavaAn Interesting Method to Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to nMinimum time required to rot all orangesFind maximum level sum in Binary TreeSum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size k.Distance of nearest cell having 1 in a binary matrixLevel order traversal line by line | Set 2 (Using Two Queues)First negative integer in every window of size kMinimum sum of squares of character counts in a given string after removing k charactersQueue based approach for first non-repeating character in a streamAverages of Levels in Binary TreeStack Permutations (Check if an array is stack permutation of other)Check if all levels of two trees are anagrams or notCheck mirror in n-ary treeCheck if X can give change to every person in the QueueQuick Links :â€˜Practice Problemsâ€™ on Queueâ€˜Videosâ€™ on Queueâ€˜Quizzesâ€™ on QueueGeeksforgeeks Courses:1.
