Assume that log(x) returns log value in base 2. C++void fun(){ int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) cout << "GeeksforGeeks";} // This code is contributed by SHUBHAMSINGH10.Cvoid fun(){ int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) printf("GeeksforGeeks");}Javastatic void fun(){ int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) System.out.printf("GeeksforGeeks");} // This code is contributed by umadevi9616Python3import mathdef fun(): i = 0 j = 0 for i in range(1, n + 1): for j in range(1,math.log(i) + 1): print("GeeksforGeeks") # This code is contributed by SHUBHAMSINGH10.C#static void fun(){ int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) Console.Write("GeeksforGeeks");} // This code is contributed by umadevi9616Javascriptconst fun(){ let i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= Math.log(i); j++) document.write("GeeksforGeeks");} // This code is contributed by SHUBHAMSINGH10.Time Complexity of the above function can be written as θ(log 1) + θ(log 2) + θ(log 3) + . . . . + θ(log n) which is θ(log n!)Order of growth of ‘log n!’ and ‘n log n’ is same for large values of n, i.e., θ(log n!) = θ(n log n). So time complexity of fun() is θ(n log n).The expression θ(log n!) = θ(n log n) can be easily derived from following Stirling’s approximation (or Stirling’s formula). log n! = n*log n - n = O(n*log(n)) Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximationMy Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousNP-Completeness | Set 1 (Introduction)Next Merge SortRecommended ArticlesPage :Time Complexity and Space Complexity11, Jul 21An interesting time complexity question09, Feb 15Time Complexity of building a heap28, May 11Time Complexity where loop variable is incremented by 1, 2, 3, 4 ..01, Sep 15Time Complexity of a Loop when Loop variable “Expands or Shrinks” exponentially22, Nov 16Understanding Time Complexity with Simple Examples14, Nov 17Time complexity of recursive Fibonacci program20, Oct 17Practice Questions on Time Complexity Analysis12, Dec 17Python Code for time Complexity plot of Heap Sort06, Sep 18Logarithmic vs Double Logarithmic Time Complexity15, Oct 21C program for Time Complexity plot of Bubble, Insertion and Selection Sort using Gnuplot17, Jan 20Time Complexity of Loop with Powers30, Aug 15Miscellaneous Problems of Time Complexity01, Aug 21Time Complexity Analysis | Tower Of Hanoi (Recursion)27, Feb 18Time Complexity of Euclidean Algorithm24, Mar 21What does 'Space Complexity' mean?17, Jun 11Complexity of different operations in Binary tree, Binary Search Tree and AVL tree19, Jan 18Knowing the complexity in competitive programming24, May 18Cyclomatic Complexity20, Jun 18Complexity Analysis of Binary Search29, May 19Complexity analysis of various operations of Binary Min Heap26, Jun 20Prune-and-Search | A Complexity Analysis Overview19, Jul 21Computational Complexity v/s Chomsky Hierarchy15, Oct 21Types of Complexity Classes | P, NP, CoNP, NP hard and NP complete30, Dec 21Article Contributed By :GeeksforGeeksVote for difficultyCurrent difficulty : EasyEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertImproved By :vroghelia6umadevi9616SHUBHAMSINGH10Article Tags :AnalysisReport IssueWriting code in comment?
