There are three exercises in this chapter, Exercise 3.1 explained How to locate a point on the coordinate plane?. While Exercises 3.2 and 3.3 discussed the topic ‘Plotting a point in the plane if its coordinates are given’.Exercise 3.1Exercise 3.2Exercise 3.3Chapter 4: Linear Equations in Two Variables Linear equations in one variable have been already discussed in earlier classes which deals with unique solutions. Now, in this chapter linear equation comes with two variables like ax + by + c = 0. Exercises 4.1 and 4.3 are designed to learn about the formation and determination of the solution of a linear equation in two variables. However, Exercises 4.3 and 4.4 gave detail learning of the topic of the graph of a linear equation in two variables.Exercise 4.1Exercise 4.2Exercise 4.3 Exercise 4.4Chapter 5: Introduction to Euclid’s GeometryThe chapter Introduction to Euclid’s Geometry explains Euclid’s method to geometry and linked it with modern day’s geometry. Euclid approached geometry by defining different axioms and postulates. This chapter contains two exercises, both Exercises 5.1 and 5.2 are based on the terms defined in the provided axioms and postulates.Exercise 5.1 Exercise 5.2Chapter 6: Lines and AnglesAs the name of the chapter says, this chapter deals with the properties of the angle formed when two or more lines intersect each other and the properties of these angles formed. This chapter consists of three exercises in which Exercises 6.1 and 6.2 give the knowledge about the different types of angles linear, reflex, right, obtuse, acute, complementary, and supplementary angles and their measures. Moreover, Exercise 6.3 covers the topic of angle sum property. Exercise 6.1Exercise 6.2Exercise 6.3Chapter 7: TrianglesThis chapter gives a detailed description of the congruence of triangles, their rules, properties, and the inequalities in triangles. In total five exercises, the latter topics are covered. Exercises 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 lay emphases on the topic of congruence of triangles and properties of triangles. Further, Exercises 7.4 and 7.5 are based on the triangle inequalities.Exercise 7.1Exercise 7.2Exercise 7.3Exercise 7.4Exercise 7.5Chapter 8: QuadrilateralThe chapter Quadrilateral is all about the different types of quadrilaterals (rectangle, square, parallelogram, trapezium, etc) and their different properties like the angle sum property of a quadrilateral. Further, a brief introduction of the midpoint theorem and its converse is provided in the last section of the chapter. This chapter consists of two exercises, in which exercise 8.1 helps to learn about the different properties of different quadrilaterals while exercise 8.2 explains the application of the mid-point theorem and its converse.Exercise 8.1Exercise 8.2Chapter 9: Areas of Parallelograms and TrianglesAs the name suggests Areas of parallelogram and triangles, this chapter gives the understanding of the formula to determine the areas of different closed shapes using the relation between the areas of different geometric shapes. A total of four exercises present in the chapter in which Exercise 9.1 is based on the topic ‘Figures on the Same Base and Between the same parallels’. While Exercise 9.2 is based on the problems on the theorem for the parallelograms that have the same area and Exercises 9.3 and 9.4 cover the problems from the topic, triangles on the same base and between the same Parallels.Exercise 9.1Exercise 9.2Exercise 9.3 Set 1, Set 2Exercise 9.4Chapter 10: Circles This chapter is related to the different properties and the terminology of the circles. Total 6 exercises are there in the chapter, Exercise 10.1 and 10.2 are related to the terminologies and the basic properties of the circles. However, Exercise 10.3 is based on the two theorems of the circles. Exercise 10.4 works upon the problem related to equal chords and their distances from the centre.
