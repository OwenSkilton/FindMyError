JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Continue Statement in JavaDifficulty Level : BasicLast Updated : 04 Sep, 2021Suppose a person wants code to execute for the values as per the code is designed to be executed but forcefully the same user wants to skip out the execution for which code should have been executed as designed above but will not as per the demand of the user. In simpler words, it is a decision-making problem as per the demand of the user.Real-Life Example:Consider a man is climbing up to go to his house in between there are 11 stairs. Being in hurry to climb up he directly stepped onto 3 staircases and then 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and jumps to last one. During this he missed out staircase 1st, 2nd and 10th and he completed the goal to reach his house. He continued his journey skipping staircase of. his choices. In computers, it interprets staircases which is/are supposed to be skipped as ‘continue’. The action to miss out execution which are supposed to be executed, is interpreted as continue statement be it any programming language.Continue statement is often used inside in programming languages inside loops control structures. Inside the loop, when a continue statement is encountered the control directly jumps to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration instead of executing the statements of the current iteration. The continue statement is used when we want to skip a particular condition and continue the rest execution. Java continue statement is used for all type od loops but it is generally used in for, while, and do-while loops.In the case of for loop, the continue keyword force control to jump immediately to the update statement.Whereas in the case of a while loop or do-while loop, control immediately jumps to the Boolean expression.Syntax: continue keyword along with a semicoloncontinue;Flow Chart of Continue StatementThe above flowchart is most important for the understanding of this keyword. Always remember the condition is always placed inside diamond boxes and statements in rectangular boxes. Now jumping onto the implementation partCase 1: Continue statement inside for loopIn this program, illustration for how to use the continue statement within For loop. When the value of ‘i’ becomes 10 or 12, the continue statement plays its role and skip their execution but for other values of’ ‘i’ the loop will run smoothly.Java// Java Program to illustrate the use of continue statement // Importing Classes/Filesimport java.util.*;public class GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String args[]) { // For loop for iteration for (int i = 0; i <= 15; i++) { // Check condition for continue if (i == 10 || i == 12) { // Using continue statement to skip the // execution of loop when i==10 or i==12 continue; } // Printing elements to show continue statement System.out.print(i + " "); } }}Output :0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 13 14 15 Case 2: Continue statement inside while loopIn the above program, we give example, how to use the continue statement within the While loop. When the value of count becomes 7 or 15, the continue statement plays its role and skip their execution but for other values of the count, the loop will run smoothly.Java// Java Program to illustrate the use of continue statement// inside the While looppublic class GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String args[]) { // Initializing a variable say it count to a value // greater than the value greater among the loop // values int count = 20; // While loop for iteration while (count >= 0) { if (count == 7 || count == 15) { count--; // Decrementing variable initialized above // Showing continue execution inside loop // skipping when count==7 or count==15 continue; } // Printing values after continue statement System.out.print(count + " "); // Decrementing the count variable count--; } }}Output:20 19 18 17 16 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Case 3: Continue statement inside do while loopIn the above program, we give example, how to use the continue statement within the do-While loop. When the value of i becomes 4 or 18, the continue statement plays its role and skip their execution but for other values of i, the loop will run smoothly.Java// Java Program to illustrate the use of continue statement// inside the Do-While loop // Importing generic Classes/Filesimport java.util.*; public class GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Creating and Initializing a variable int i = 0; // Do-While loop for iteration do { if (i == 4 || i == 18) { // Incrementing loop variable by 2 i += 2; // Illustrating continue statement skipping // the execution when i==7 or i==15 continue; } // Printing to showcase continue affect System.out.println(i); // Incrementing variable by 2 i += 2; // Condition check } while (i <= 35); }}Output:0 2 6 8 10 12 14 16 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34Case 4: Continue statement inside Inner loop(Nested Loop)In the above program, we give example, how to use the continue statement within Nested loops. When the value of i becomes 3 and j become 2, the continue statement plays its role and skip their execution but for other values of i and j, the loop will run smoothly.Java// Java Program to illustrate the use of continue statement// inside an inner loop or simply nested loops // Importing generic Classes/Filesimport java.util.*; public class GFG { // Main drive method public static void main(String[] args) { // Outer loop for iteration for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) { // Inner loop for iteration for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) { if (i == 3 && j == 2) { // Continue statement in inner loop to // skip the execution when i==3 and j==2 continue; } // Print elements to showcase keyword affect System.out.println(i + " * " + j); } } }}Output: 1 * 1 1 * 2 1 * 3 2 * 1 2 * 2 2 * 3 3 * 1 3 * 3 4 * 1 4 * 2 4 * 3My Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousFor-each loop in JavaNext Break statement in JavaRecommended ArticlesPage :Break and Continue statement in Java02, Sep 20Decision Making in Java (if, if-else, switch, break, continue, jump)15, Mar 17Switch Statement in Java15, May 17Unreachable statement using final and non-final variable in Java16, Aug 18Break statement in Java04, Nov 19Java if-else statement with Examples20, Nov 19Java if statement with Examples20, Nov 19Enhancements for Switch Statement in Java 1323, Oct 20Java Program to Print any Statement without Using the Main Method16, Nov 20How to Use Callable Statement in Java to Call Stored Procedure?03, Mar 21Import Statement in Java28, Nov 21Difference Between java.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp and java.sql.Date in Java07, Apr 21How to Convert java.sql.Date to java.util.Date in Java?02, Feb 21Different Ways to Convert java.util.Date to java.time.LocalDate in Java05, Jan 21How to Convert java.util.Date to java.sql.Date in Java?23, Mar 21Java.util.BitSet class methods in Java with Examples | Set 218, Nov 16Java.Lang.Float class in Java27, Mar 17Java.io.BufferedInputStream class in Java20, Jan 17Java.io.ObjectInputStream Class in Java | Set 102, Feb 17Java.util.BitSet class in Java with Examples | Set 116, Nov 16Java.io.BufferedWriter class methods in Java29, Dec 16Java.io.DataOutputStream in Java06, Jan 17Java.io.StreamTokenizer Class in Java | Set 106, Jan 17Java.io.InputStream Class in Java09, Jan 17Article Contributed By :vanshgaur14866@vanshgaur14866Vote for difficultyCurrent difficulty : BasicEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertImproved By :simmytarika5Article Tags :Java-Control-FlowJavaPractice Tags :Java-Control-FlowJavaReport IssueWriting code in comment?
