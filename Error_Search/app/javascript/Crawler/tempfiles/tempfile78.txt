Some of the basic data structures are Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues etc.This page will contain some of the complex and advanced Data Structures like Disjoint Sets, Self-Balancing Trees, Segment Trees, Tries etc.‘Recent Articles’Topics:Advanced ListsSegment TreeTrieBinary Indexed TreeSuffix Array and TreeSelf-Balancing BSTsK Dimensional TreeDisjoint Setn-ary TreeOthersMiscPractice
