It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.A matrix with 9 elements is shown below.This Matrix [M] has 3 rows and 3 columns. Each element of matrix [M] can be referred to by its row and column number. For example, a23 = 6.Recent Articles on MatrixRotate Matrix ElementsInplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees | Set 1Rotate a matrix by 90 degree without using any extra space | Set 2Rotate a Matrix
