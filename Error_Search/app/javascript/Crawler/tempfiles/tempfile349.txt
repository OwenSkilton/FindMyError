It provides a scalable and concurrent version of NavigableSet in Java. The implementation of ConcurrentSkipListSet is based on ConcurrentSkipListMap. The elements in ConcurrentSkipListSet are sorted by default in their natural ordering or by a Comparator provided at set creation time, depending on which constructor is used.Since it implements SortedSet<E> and NavigableSet<E>, it is similar to TreeSet with an added feature of being concurrent. Since it is a thread-safe, it can be used by multiple threads concurrently whereas TreeSet is not thread-safe.Class Hierarchy: Declaration: public class ConcurrentSkipListSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E> implements NavigableSet<E>, Cloneable, Serializable Where E is the type of elements maintained by this collection Some important points on ConcurrentSkipListSet:It implements Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, NavigableSet<E>, Set<E>, SortedSet<E> interfaces.It does not allow null elements, because null arguments and return values cannot be reliably distinguished from the absence of elements.Its implementation provides average log(n) time cost for contains, add, and remove operations and their variants.It is thread-safe.It should be preferred over implementing Set interface when concurrent modification of set is required.Constructors:1. ConcurrentSkipListSet(): This constructor is used to construct an empty set.ConcurrentSkipListSet<E> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<E>();2. ConcurrentSkipListSet(Collection<E> c): This constructor is used to construct a set with the elements of the Collection passed as the parameter.ConcurrentSkipListSet<E> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<E>(Collection<E> c);3. ConcurrentSkipListSet(Comparator<E> comparator): This constructor is used to construct a new, empty set that orders its elements according to the specified comparator.ConcurrentSkipListSet<E> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<E>(Comparator<E> comparator);4. ConcurrentSkipListSet(SortedSet<E> s): This constructor is used to construct a new set containing the same elements and using the same ordering as the specified sorted set.ConcurrentSkipListSet<E> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<E>(SortedSet<E> s);Example 1:Java// Java program to demonstrate ConcurrentSkipListSet import java.util.*;import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet; class ConcurrentSkipListSetLastExample1 { public static void main(String[] args) { // Initializing the set using // ConcurrentSkipListSet() ConcurrentSkipListSet<Integer> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<Integer>(); // Adding elements to this set set.add(78); set.add(64); set.add(12); set.add(45); set.add(8); // Printing the ConcurrentSkipListSet System.out.println("ConcurrentSkipListSet: " + set); // Initializing the set using // ConcurrentSkipListSet(Collection) ConcurrentSkipListSet<Integer> set1 = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<Integer>(set); // Printing the ConcurrentSkipListSet1 System.out.println("ConcurrentSkipListSet1: " + set1); // Initializing the set using // ConcurrentSkipListSet() ConcurrentSkipListSet<String> set2 = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>(); // Adding elements to this set set2.add("Apple"); set2.add("Lemon"); set2.add("Banana"); set2.add("Apple"); // creating an iterator Iterator<String> itr = set2.iterator(); System.out.print("Fruits Set: "); while (itr.hasNext()) { System.out.print(itr.next() + " "); } }}Output:ConcurrentSkipListSet: [8, 12, 45, 64, 78] ConcurrentSkipListSet1: [8, 12, 45, 64, 78] Fruits Set: Apple Banana Lemon Example 2: Java// Java program to demonstrate ConcurrentSkipListSet import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet; class ConcurrentSkipListSetLastExample1 { public static void main(String[] args) { // Initializing the set using ConcurrentSkipListSet() ConcurrentSkipListSet<Integer> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<Integer>(); // Adding elements to this set // using add() method set.add(78); set.add(64); set.add(12); set.add(45); set.add(8); // Printing the ConcurrentSkipListSet System.out.println("ConcurrentSkipListSet: " + set); // Printing the highest element of the set // using last() method System.out.println("The highest element of the set: " + set.last()); // Retrieving and removing first element of the set System.out.println("The first element of the set: " + set.pollFirst()); // Checks if 9 is present in the set // using contains() method if (set.contains(9)) System.out.println("9 is present in the set."); else System.out.println("9 is not present in the set."); // Printing the size of the set // using size() method System.out.println("Number of elements in the set = " + set.size()); }}Output:ConcurrentSkipListSet: [8, 12, 45, 64, 78] The highest element of the set: 78 The first element of the set: 8 9 is not present in the set.
