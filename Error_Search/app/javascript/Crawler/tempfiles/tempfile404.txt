Arrays are objects and object variables are always references in Java. So, when we declare an object variable as final, it means that the variable cannot be changed to refer to anything else. For example, the following program 1 compiles without any error and program 2 fails in compilation.// Program 1class Test { int p = 20; public static void main(String args[]) { final Test t = new Test(); t.p = 30; System.out.println(t.p); } }Output: 30// Program 2class Test { int p = 20; public static void main(String args[]) { final Test t1 = new Test(); Test t2 = new Test(); t1 = t2; System.out.println(t1.p); } }Output: Compiler Error: cannot assign a value to final variable t1So a final array means that the array variable which is actually a reference to an object, cannot be changed to refer to anything else, but the members of array can be modified.As an exercise, predict the output of following programclass Test { public static void main(String args[]) { final int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; int arr2[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; arr2 = arr1; arr1 = arr2; for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) System.out.println(arr2[i]); } }Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Attention reader!
