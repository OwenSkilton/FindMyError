Especially today, amid a pandemic, social media platforms are being used to dish out misinformation at lightning speed. So, it is essentially important to have something that can help people fight with these fake news. You need to submit ideas on how we can detect these fake news related to covid-19. You don't need to provide the full product but just the POC (proof of concept).What is POC: A proof of concept, or POC, is an experiment intended to show that a program, product, or system can be successfully deployed in the real world. You can use any technology that you are most comfortable with, to solve the problem statement. You just need to show how that technology will help you in deploying this model, but don't actually need to deploy.
