JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article NavigableSet in Java with ExamplesDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 28 Jun, 2021NavigableSet represents a navigable set in Java Collection Framework. The NavigableSet interface inherits from the SortedSet interface. It behaves like a SortedSet with the exception that we have navigation methods available in addition to the sorting mechanisms of the SortedSet. For example, the NavigableSet interface can navigate the set in reverse order compared to the order defined in SortedSet. A NavigableSet may be accessed and traversed in either ascending or descending order. The classes that implement this interface are, TreeSet and ConcurrentSkipListSetHere, E is the type of elements maintained by this set.All Superinterfaces:Collection<E>, Iterable<E>, Set<E>, SortedSet<E>All Known Implementing Classes:ConcurrentSkipListSet, TreeSet<E>Declaration: The NavigableSet is declared aspublic interface NavigableSet<E> extends SortedSet<E> Creating NavigableSet ObjectsSince NavigableSet is an interface, objects cannot be created of the type NavigableSet. We always need a class that extends this list in order to create an object. And also, after the introduction of Generics in Java 1.5, it is possible to restrict the type of object that can be stored in the NavigableSet. This type-safe set can be defined as:// Obj is the type of the object to be stored in NavigableSetNavigableSet<Obj> set = new TreeSet<Obj> ();Example:Java// Java program to demonstrate// the working of NavigableSetimport java.util.NavigableSet;import java.util.TreeSet; public class NavigableSetDemo{ public static void main(String[] args) { NavigableSet<Integer> ns = new TreeSet<>(); ns.add(0); ns.add(1); ns.add(2); ns.add(3); ns.add(4); ns.add(5); ns.add(6); // Get a reverse view of the navigable set NavigableSet<Integer> reverseNs = ns.descendingSet(); // Print the normal and reverse views System.out.println("Normal order: " + ns); System.out.println("Reverse order: " + reverseNs); NavigableSet<Integer> threeOrMore = ns.tailSet(3, true); System.out.println("3 or more: " + threeOrMore); System.out.println("lower(3): " + ns.lower(3)); System.out.println("floor(3): " + ns.floor(3)); System.out.println("higher(3): " + ns.higher(3)); System.out.println("ceiling(3): " + ns.ceiling(3)); System.out.println("pollFirst(): " + ns.pollFirst()); System.out.println("Navigable Set: " + ns); System.out.println("pollLast(): " + ns.pollLast()); System.out.println("Navigable Set: " + ns); System.out.println("pollFirst(): " + ns.pollFirst()); System.out.println("Navigable Set: " + ns); System.out.println("pollFirst(): " + ns.pollFirst()); System.out.println("Navigable Set: " + ns); System.out.println("pollFirst(): " + ns.pollFirst()); System.out.println("Navigable Set: " + ns); System.out.println("pollFirst(): " + ns.pollFirst()); System.out.println("pollLast(): " + ns.pollLast()); }}OutputNormal order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Reverse order: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] 3 or more: [3, 4, 5, 6] lower(3): 2 floor(3): 3 higher(3): 4 ceiling(3): 3 pollFirst(): 0 Navigable Set: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] pollLast(): 6 Navigable Set: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] pollFirst(): 1 Navigable Set: [2, 3, 4, 5] pollFirst(): 2 Navigable Set: [3, 4, 5] pollFirst(): 3 Navigable Set: [4, 5] pollFirst(): 4 pollLast(): 5 Performing Various Operations on NavigableSetSince NavigableSet is an interface, it can be used only with a class that implements this interface. TreeSet is the class that implements the NavigableSet interface. Now, let’s see how to perform a few frequently used operations on the TreeSet.1. Adding Elements: In order to add an element to the NavigableSet, we can use the add() method. However, the insertion order is not retained in the TreeSet. Internally, for every element, the values are compared and sorted in the ascending order. We need to keep a note that duplicate elements are not allowed and all the duplicate elements are ignored. And also, Null values are not accepted by the NavigableSet.Java// Java code to demonstrate// adding of elements in// NavigableSetimport java.util.*;import java.io.*; class NavigableSetDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { NavigableSet<String> ts = new TreeSet<String>(); // Elements are added using add() method ts.add("A"); ts.add("B"); ts.add("C"); ts.add("A"); System.out.println(ts); }}Output:[A, B, C] 2. Accessing the Elements: After adding the elements, if we wish to access the elements, we can use inbuilt methods like contains(), first(), last(), etc.contains()first()last()Java// Java program to access// the elements of NavigableSetimport java.util.*;import java.io.*; class NavigableSetDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { NavigableSet<String> ts = new TreeSet<String>(); // Elements are added using add() method ts.add("A"); ts.add("B"); ts.add("C"); ts.add("A"); System.out.println("Navigable Set is " + ts); String check = "D"; // Check if the above string exists in // the NavigableSet or not System.out.println("Contains " + check + " " + ts.contains(check)); // Print the first element in // the NavigableSet System.out.println("First Value " + ts.first()); // Print the last element in // the NavigableSet System.out.println("Last Value " + ts.last()); }}Output:Navigable Set is [A, B, C] Contains D false First Value A Last Value C 3. Removing the Values: The values can be removed from the NavigableSet using the remove(), pollFirst(), pollLast() methods.remove()pollFirst()pollLast()Java// Java Program to remove the// elements from NavigableSetimport java.util.*;import java.io.*; class NavigableSetDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { NavigableSet<String> ts = new TreeSet<String>(); // Elements are added using add() method ts.add("A"); ts.add("B"); ts.add("C"); ts.add("B"); ts.add("D"); ts.add("E"); System.out.println("Initial TreeSet " + ts); // Removing the element b ts.remove("B"); System.out.println("After removing element " + ts); // Remove the First element of TreeSet ts.pollFirst(); System.out.println( "After the removal of First Element " + ts); // Remove the Last element of TreeSet ts.pollLast(); System.out.println( "After the removal of Last Element " + ts); }}Output:Initial TreeSet [A, B, C, D, E] After removing element [A, C, D, E] After the removal of First Element [C, D, E] After the removal of Last Element [C, D] 4. Iterating through the NavigableSet: There are various ways to iterate through the NavigableSet. The most famous one is to use the enhanced for loop.Java// Java program to iterate// through NavigableSet import java.util.*;import java.io.*; class NavigableSetDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { NavigableSet<String> ts = new TreeSet<String>(); // Elements are added using add() method ts.add("C"); ts.add("D"); ts.add("E"); ts.add("A"); ts.add("B"); ts.add("Z"); // Iterating though the NavigableSet for (String value : ts) System.out.print(value + ", "); System.out.println(); }}Output:A, B, C, D, E, Z, Methods of Navigable SetThe following are the methods present in the NavigableSet interface.

Methods inherited from interface java.util.SortedSetMETHODDESCRIPTIONcomparator() This method returns the comparator used to order the elements in this set, or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements.first()This method returns the first(lowest) element present in this set.last()This method returns the last(highest) element present in the set.spliterator()Creates a Spliterator over the elements in this sorted set.Methods inherited from interface java.util.SetMETHODDESCRIPTIONadd(element)This method is used to add a specific element to the set. The function adds the element only if the specified element is not already present in the set else the function returns False if the element is already present in the Set.addAll(collection) This method is used to append all of the elements from the mentioned collection to the existing set. The elements are added randomly without following any specific order.clear() This method is used to remove all the elements from the set but not delete the set.

It returns an integer value which is the hashCode value for this instance of the Set.isEmpty()This method is used to check if a NavigableSet is empty or not.remove(element)This method is used to remove the given element from the set. This method returns True if the specified element is present in the Set otherwise it returns False.removeAll(collection)This method is used to remove all the elements from the collection which are present in the set. This method returns true if this set changed as a result of the call.retainAll(collection)This method is used to retain all the elements from the set which are mentioned in the given collection. This method returns true if this set changed as a result of the call.size()This method is used to get the size of the set. This returns an integer value which signifies the number of elements.toArray()This method is used to form an array of the same elements as that of the Set. toArray​(T[] a)Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.Methods declared in interface java.util.CollectionMETHODDESCRIPTIONparallelStream()Returns a possibly parallel Stream with this collection as its source.removeIf​(Predicate<? super E> filter)Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate.stream()Returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source.toArray​(IntFunction<T[]> generator)Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection, using the provided generator function to allocate the returned array.Methods declared in interface java.lang.IterableMETHODDESCRIPTIONforEach​(Consumer<? super T> action)Performs the given action for each element of the Iterable until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception.This article is contributed by Pratik Agarwal.
