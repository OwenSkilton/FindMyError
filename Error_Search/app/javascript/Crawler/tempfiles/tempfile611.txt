JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions in JavaDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 01 Nov, 2021An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. In Java, there are two types of exceptions:Checked exceptionsUnchecked exceptionsChecked ExceptionsThese are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. If some code within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using the throws keyword. For example, consider the following Java program that opens the file at location “C:\test\a.txt” and prints the first three lines of it. The program doesn’t compile, because the function main() uses FileReader() and FileReader() throws a checked exception FileNotFoundException. It also uses readLine() and close() methods, and these methods also throw checked exception IOExceptionExample:Java// Java Program to Illustrate Checked Exceptions// Where FileNotFoundException occured // Importing I/O classesimport java.io.*; // Main classclass GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Reading file from path in local directory FileReader file = new FileReader("C:\\test\\a.txt"); // Creating object as one of ways of taking input BufferedReader fileInput = new BufferedReader(file); // Printing first 3 lines of file "C:\test\a.txt" for (int counter = 0; counter < 3; counter++) System.out.println(fileInput.readLine()); // Closing file connections // using close() method fileInput.close(); }}Output: To fix the above program, we either need to specify a list of exceptions using throws, or we need to use a try-catch block. We have used throws in the below program. Since FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException, we can just specify IOException in the throws list and make the above program compiler-error-free.Example:Java// Java Program to Illustrate Checked Exceptions// Where FileNotFoundException does not occur // Importing I/O classesimport java.io.*; // Main classclass GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { // Creating a file and reading from local repository FileReader file = new FileReader("C:\\test\\a.txt"); // Reading content inside a file BufferedReader fileInput = new BufferedReader(file); // Printing first 3 lines of file "C:\test\a.txt" for (int counter = 0; counter < 3; counter++) System.out.println(fileInput.readLine()); // Closing all file connections // using close() method // Good practice to avoid any memory leakage fileInput.close(); }}Output: First three lines of file "C:\test\a.txt"Unchecked Exceptions These are the exceptions that are not checked at compile time. In C++, all exceptions are unchecked, so it is not forced by the compiler to either handle or specify the exception. It is up to the programmers to be civilized, and specify or catch the exceptions. In Java exceptions under Error and RuntimeException classes are unchecked exceptions, everything else under throwable is checked. Consider the following Java program. It compiles fine, but it throws ArithmeticException when run. The compiler allows it to compile because ArithmeticException is an unchecked exception.Example:Java// Java Program to Illustrate Un-checked Exceptions // Main classclass GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String args[]) { // Here we are dividing by 0 // which will not be caught at compile time // as there is no mistake but caught at runtime // because it is mathematically incorrect int x = 0; int y = 10; int z = y / x; }}Output: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero at Main.main(Main.java:5) Java Result: 1Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveMy Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousTypes of Exception in Java with ExamplesNext Try, catch, throw and throws in JavaRecommended ArticlesPage :Java Program to Handle Unchecked Exception03, Nov 20Chained Exceptions in Java27, Oct 16Exceptions in Java23, Dec 16Built-in Exceptions in Java with examples04, Oct 17Using throw, catch and instanceof to handle Exceptions in Java27, Apr 18Java Program to Handle Runtime Exceptions15, Nov 20Java Program to Handle Divide By Zero and Multiple Exceptions01, Nov 20Java Program to Use finally block for Catching Exceptions24, Nov 20User Defined Exceptions using Constructors in Java27, Jan 21How to Solve Class Cast Exceptions in Java?02, Feb 21Java Program to Use Exceptions with Thread29, Nov 20Top 5 Exceptions in Java with Examples18, Jan 21Errors V/s Exceptions In Java24, Jul 18Java Program to Handle Checked Exception26, Oct 20Difference Between java.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp and java.sql.Date in Java07, Apr 21How to Convert java.sql.Date to java.util.Date in Java?02, Feb 21Different Ways to Convert java.util.Date to java.time.LocalDate in Java05, Jan 21How to Convert java.util.Date to java.sql.Date in Java?23, Mar 21Java.util.BitSet class methods in Java with Examples | Set 218, Nov 16Java.Lang.Float class in Java27, Mar 17Java.io.BufferedInputStream class in Java20, Jan 17Java.io.ObjectInputStream Class in Java | Set 102, Feb 17Java.util.BitSet class in Java with Examples | Set 116, Nov 16Java.io.BufferedWriter class methods in Java29, Dec 16Article Contributed By :GeeksforGeeksVote for difficultyCurrent difficulty : EasyEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertImproved By :sakshamcseranjeethnivasArticle Tags :Java-ExceptionsJavaPractice Tags :JavaReport IssueWriting code in comment?
