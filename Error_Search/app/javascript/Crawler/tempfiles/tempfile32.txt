Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary Search.Linear Search to find the element “20” in a given list of numbersBinary Search to find the element “23” in a given list of numbersTopic :Searching AlgorithmsComparisonsLibrary Implementations of Searching AlgorithmsCoding ProblemsQuick LinksSearching Algorithms :Linear SearchBinary SearchJump SearchInterpolation SearchExponential SearchSublist Search (Search a linked list in another list)Fibonacci SearchThe Ubiquitous Binary SearchRecursive program to linearly search an element in a given arrayRecursive function to do substring searchUnbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time)Comparisons :Linear Search vs Binary SearchInterpolation search vs Binary searchWhy is Binary Search preferred over Ternary Search?Library Implementations of Searching Algorithms :Binary Search functions in C++ STL (binary_search, lower_bound and upper_bound)Arrays.binarySearch() in Java with examples | Set 1Arrays.binarySearch() in Java with examples | Set 2 (Search in subarray)Collections.binarySearch() in Java with ExamplesCoding Problems :Find the Missing NumberSearch an element in a sorted and rotated arrayMedian of two sorted arraysTwo elements whose sum is closest to zeroFind the smallest and second smallest element in an arrayMaximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisonsk largest(or smallest) elements in an array | added Min Heap methodCeiling in a sorted arrayCount number of occurrences (or frequency) in a sorted arrayFind the repeating and the missing | Added 3 new methodsFind a Fixed Point in a given arrayFind the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasingFind a pair with the given differenceFind the k most frequent words from a fileMedian of two sorted arrays of different sizesFind a peak elementGiven an array of of size n and a number k, find all elements that appear more than n/k timesFind the minimum element in a sorted and rotated arrayKth smallest element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2D array | Set 1Find k closest elements to a given valueSearch in an almost sorted arrayA Problem in Many Binary Search ImplementationsFind the first repeating element in an array of integersFind common elements in three sorted arraysCount 1’s in a sorted binary arrayGiven a sorted array and a number x, find the pair in array whose sum is closest to xFind the closest pair from two sorted arraysK’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array | Set 1K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array | Set 2 (Expected Linear Time)K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array | Set 3 (Worst Case Linear Time)Find position of an element in a sorted array of infinite numbersGiven a sorted and rotated array, find if there is a pair with a given sumFind the largest pair sum in an unsorted arrayFind the nearest smaller numbers on left side in an arrayK’th largest element in a streamFind a pair with maximum product in array of IntegersFind the element that appears once in a sorted arrayFind the odd appearing element in O(Log n) timeFind the largest three elements in an arraySearch an element in an array where difference between adjacent elements is 1Find three closest elements from given three sorted arraysFind the element before which all the elements are smaller than it, and after which all are greaterBinary Search for Rational Numbers without using floating point arithmeticFloor in a Sorted ArrayThird largest element in an array of distinct elementsSecond minimum element using minimum comparisonsQueries for greater than and not less thanEfficient search in an array where difference between adjacent is 1Print all possible sums of consecutive numbers with sum NMinimum time required to produce m itemsMake all array elements equal with minimum costCheck if there exist two elements in an array whose sum is equal to the sum of rest of the arrayCheck if reversing a sub array make the array sortedFind all triplets with zero sumSearch, insert and delete in an unsorted arraySearch, insert and delete in a sorted arrayMove all occurrences of an element to end in a linked listSearch in an array of strings where non-empty strings are sortedSmallest Difference Triplet from Three arraysBest First Search (Informed Search)Quick Links :‘Practice Problems’ on Searching‘Quizzes’ on SearchingIf you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
