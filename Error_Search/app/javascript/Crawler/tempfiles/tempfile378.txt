JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Jagged Array in JavaDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 15 Nov, 2021Prerequisite: Arrays in JavaA jagged array is an array of arrays such that member arrays can be of different sizes, i.e., we can create a 2-D array but with a variable number of columns in each row. These types of arrays are also known as Jagged arrays. Pictorial representation of Jagged array in Memory:Jagged_array Declaration and Initialization of Jagged array :Syntax: data_type array_name[][] = new data_type[n][]; //n: no. of rows array_name[] = new data_type[n1] //n1= no. of columns in row-1 array_name[] = new data_type[n2] //n2= no. of columns in row-2 array_name[] = new data_type[n3] //n3= no. of columns in row-3 . . . array_name[] = new data_type[nk] //nk=no. of columns in row-n Alternative, ways to Initialize a Jagged array : int arr_name[][] = new int[][] { new int[] {10, 20, 30 ,40}, new int[] {50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}, new int[] {110, 120} }; OR int[][] arr_name = { new int[] {10, 20, 30 ,40}, new int[] {50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}, new int[] {110, 120} }; OR int[][] arr_name = { {10, 20, 30 ,40}, {50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}, {110, 120} };Following are Java programs to demonstrate the above concept. Java// Program to demonstrate 2-D jagged array in Javaclass Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // Declaring 2-D array with 2 rows int arr[][] = new int[2][]; // Making the above array Jagged // First row has 3 columns arr[0] = new int[3]; // Second row has 2 columns arr[1] = new int[2]; // Initializing array int count = 0; for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) arr[i][j] = count++; // Displaying the values of 2D Jagged array System.out.println("Contents of 2D Jagged Array"); for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " "); System.out.println(); } }}OutputContents of 2D Jagged Array 0 1 2 3 4 Following is another example where i’th row has i columns, i.e., the first row has 1 element, the second row has two elements and so on.Java// Another Java program to demonstrate 2-D jagged// array such that first row has 1 element, second// row has two elements and so on.class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int r = 5; // Declaring 2-D array with 5 rows int arr[][] = new int[r][]; // Creating a 2D array such that first row // has 1 element, second row has two // elements and so on. for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) arr[i] = new int[i + 1]; // Initializing array int count = 0; for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) arr[i][j] = count++; // Displaying the values of 2D Jagged array System.out.println("Contents of 2D Jagged Array"); for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " "); System.out.println(); } }}OutputContents of 2D Jagged Array 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 This article is contributed by Rahul Agrawal.
