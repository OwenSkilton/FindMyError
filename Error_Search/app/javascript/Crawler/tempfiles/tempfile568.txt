JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article User-defined Custom Exception in JavaDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 27 May, 2017Java provides us facility to create our own exceptions which are basically derived classes of Exception. For example MyException in below code extends the Exception class.We pass the string to the constructor of the super class- Exception which is obtained using “getMessage()” function on the object created.// A Class that represents use-defined expceptionclass MyException extends Exception{ public MyException(String s) { // Call constructor of parent Exception super(s); }} // A Class that uses above MyExceptionpublic class Main{ // Driver Program public static void main(String args[]) { try { // Throw an object of user defined exception throw new MyException("GeeksGeeks"); } catch (MyException ex) { System.out.println("Caught"); // Print the message from MyException object System.out.println(ex.getMessage()); } }}Output:Caught GeeksGeeksIn the above code, constructor of MyException requires a string as its argument. The string is passed to parent class Exception’s constructor using super(). The constructor of Exception class can also be called without a parameter and call to super is not mandatory.// A Class that represents use-defined expceptionclass MyException extends Exception{ } // A Class that uses above MyExceptionpublic class setText{ // Driver Program public static void main(String args[]) { try { // Throw an object of user defined exception throw new MyException(); } catch (MyException ex) { System.out.println("Caught"); System.out.println(ex.getMessage()); } }}Output:Caught nullThis article is contributed by Pranjal Mathur.
