Whenever we find that current digit cannot lead to a solution, we remove it (backtrack) and try next digit. This is better than naive approach (generating all possible combinations of digits and then trying every combination one by one) as it drops a set of permutations whenever it backtracks.Topics :Standard ProblemsMiscQuick LinksStandard Problems :Backtracking | Set 1 (The Knight’s tour problem)Backtracking | Set 2 (Rat in a Maze)Backtracking | Set 3 (N Queen Problem)Backtracking | Set 4 (Subset Sum)Backtracking | Set 5 (m Coloring Problem)Backtracking | Set 6 (Hamiltonian Cycle)Backtracking | Set 7 (Sudoku)Backtracking | Set 8 (Solving Cryptarithmetic Puzzles)Backtracking | Set 9 (Magnet Puzzle)N Queen in O(n) spaceBoggle | Set 2 (Using Trie)Remove Invalid ParenthesesPrime numbers after prime P with sum SRat in a Maze with multiple steps or jump allowedA backtracking approach to generate n bit Gray CodesC++ program for Solving Cryptarithmetic PuzzlesWrite a program to print all permutations of a given stringPrint all possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrixMisc :Tug of War8 queen problemCombinational SumBacktracking to find all subsetsPower Set in Lexicographic orderCheck if a given string is sum-stringFill 8 numbers in grid with given conditionsWord Break Problem using BacktrackingMinimize number of unique characters in stringCount all possible paths between two verticesPartition of a set into K subsets with equal sumWarnsdorff’s algorithm for Knight’s tour problemLongest Possible Route in a Matrix with HurdlesMatch a pattern and String without using regular expressionsFill two instances of all numbers from 1 to n in a specific wayFind all distinct subsets of a given setFind shortest safe route in a path with landminesFind paths from corner cell to middle cell in mazeFind if there is a path of more than k length from a sourceFind Maximum number possible by doing at-most K swapsPrint all palindromic partitions of a stringPrinting all solutions in N-Queen ProblemPrint all paths from a given source to a destinationPrint all possible strings that can be made by placing spaces| Set-1Print all possible strings that can be made by placing spaces| Set-2Print all longest common sub-sequences in lexicographical orderSmallest expression to represent a number using single digitGiven an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as xCombinations where every element appears twice and distance between appearances is equal to the valueQuick Links :Top 20 Backtracking Algorithm Interview Questions‘Practice Problems’ on Backtracking‘Quiz’ on Backtracking‘Videos’ on BacktrackingIf you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using write.geeksforgeeks.org or mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
