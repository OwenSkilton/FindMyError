For more, refer abstract keyword in javaenum : It is used to define enum in Javainstanceof : It is used to know whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).private : It is an access modifier.Anything declared private cannot be seen outside of its class.protected : If you want to allow an element to be seen outside your current package, but only to classes that subclass your class directly, then declare that element protected.public : Anything declared public can be accessed from anywhere.For more on Access Modifiers, refer Access Modifiers in Javastatic :It is used to create a member(block,method,variable,nested classe) that can be used by itself, without reference to a specific instance. For more, refer static keyword in javastrictfp : It is used for restricting floating-point calculations and ensuring same result on every platform while performing operations in the floating-point variable.For more refer strictfp keyword in javasynchronized : Applicable for blocks,methods.It is used to get synchronization in java. For more, refer Synchronized in Javatransient : transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization, if we don’t want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword.For more refer transient keyword in Javavolatile : The volatile modifier tells the compiler that the variable modified by volatile can be changed unexpectedly by other parts of your program.
