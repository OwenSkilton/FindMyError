FileStreams in JavaDelete a file using JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Copying file using FileStreams in JavaDifficulty Level : BasicLast Updated : 30 May, 2018We can copy a file from one location to another using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes in Java.For this we have to import some specific classes of java.io package. So for instance let us include the entire package with statement import java.io.*;The main logic of copying file is to read the file associated to FileInputStream variable and write the read contents into the file associated with FileOutputStream variable.Methods used in the programint read(); Reads a byte of data. Present in FileInputStream. Other versions of this method : int read(byte[] bytearray) and int read(byte[] bytearray, int offset, int length)void write(int b) : Writes a byte of data. Present in FileOutputStream. Other versions of this method : void write(byte[] bytearray) and void write(byte[] bytearray, int offset, int length);/* Program to copy a src file to destination. The name of src file and dest file must be provided using command line arguments where args[0] is the name of source file and args[1] is name of destination file */ import java.io.*;class src2dest{ public static void main(String args[]) throws FileNotFoundException,IOException { /* If file doesnot exist FileInputStream throws FileNotFoundException and read() write() throws IOException if I/O error occurs */ FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(args[0]); /* assuming that the file exists and need not to be checked */ FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(args[1]); int b; while ((b=fis.read()) != -1) fos.write(b); /* read() will readonly next int so we used while loop here in order to read upto end of file and keep writing the read int into dest file */ fis.close(); fos.close(); }}This article is contributed by Parul Dang.
