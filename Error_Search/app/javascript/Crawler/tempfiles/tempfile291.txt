I was directly in touch with all the employees of the company and seeing my work making a direct impact was indeed satisfying. They were really compassionate and eager to listen to my ideas and implement them in the real world. As all the interns and employees over there were working in close proximity to each other, it was a tremendous learning curve for me. The best part about this organisation is that the working condition encourages you to work more and I never felt like being burdened. There is a feedback process followed which enables timely assessment and guidance to work in the right direction. All and all, I can say that it was a great experience working with like-minded individuals during my internship at GeeksforGeeks.Abhiraj SmitGoldman SachsDuring my stay at GeeksforGeeks I got to learn a lot.
