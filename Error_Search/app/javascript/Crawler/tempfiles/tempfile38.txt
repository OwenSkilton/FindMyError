The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program.For example: To check if a number is even or odd. This can be easily done by using Bitwise-AND(&) operator. If the last bit of the operator is set than it is ODD otherwise it is EVEN. Therefore, if num & 1 not equals to zero than num is ODD otherwise it is EVEN.Topic :BasicIntermediateHardMiscQuick LinksBasic :Find the element that appears onceDetect if two integers have opposite signsAdd 1 to a given numberMultiply a given Integer with 3.5Turn off the rightmost set bitFind whether a given number is a power of 4 or notCompute modulus division by a power-of-2-numberRotate bits of a numberFind the Number Occurring Odd Number of TimesCheck for Integer OverflowCount set bits in an integerCount number of bits to be flipped to convert A to BEfficient way to multiply with 7Program to find whether a no is power of twoPosition of rightmost set bitBinary representation of a given numberFind position of the only set bitHow to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?Swap two nibbles in a byteHow to turn off a particular bit in a number?Russian Peasant (Multiply two numbers using bitwise operators)Add two bit stringsWrite your own strcmp that ignores casesCheck if two numbers are equal without using arithmetic and comparison operatorsFind XOR of two number without using XOR operatorMore >>Intermediate :Swap bits in a given numberLittle and Big Endian MysterySmallest of three integers without comparison operatorsA Boolean Array PuzzleCompute the integer absolute value (abs) without branchingCompute the minimum or maximum of two integers without branchingFind the two non-repeating elements in an array of repeating elementsWrite an Efficient C Program to Reverse Bits of a NumberSmallest power of 2 greater than or equal to nWrite a C program to find the parity of an unsigned integerSwap all odd and even bitsCheck if binary representation of a number is palindromeGenerate n-bit Gray CodesCheck if a given number is sparse or notEuclid’s Algorithm when % and / operations are costlyFind nth Magic NumberHow to swap two bits in a given integer?Calculate square of a number without using *, / and pow()Generate 0 and 1 with 25% and 75% probabilityFind even occurring elements in an array of limited rangeCyclic Redundancy Check and Modulo-2 DivisionCopy set bits in a rangeCheck if a number is BleakCount strings with consecutive 1’sGray to Binary and Binary to Gray conversionMore >>Hard :Count total set bits in all numbers from 1 to nProgram to count number of set bits in an (big) arrayNext higher number with same number of set bitsKaratsuba algorithm for fast multiplicationFind the maximum subarray XOR in a given arrayInserting m into n such that m starts at bit j and ends at bit iFind Duplicates of array using bit arrayFind longest sequence of 1’s in binary representation with one flipClosest (or Next) smaller and greater numbers with same number of set bitsBitmasking and Dynamic Programming | Set-2 (TSP)Compute the parity of a number using XOR and table look-upXOR Encryption by Shifting PlaintextCount pairs in an array which have at least one digit commonPython program to convert floating to binaryLevelwise Alternating OR and XOR operations in Segment TreeBooth’s Multiplication AlgorithmLeftover element after performing alternate Bitwise OR and Bitwise XOR operations on adjacent pairsNumber of pairs with Pandigital ConcatenationFind the n-th number whose binary representation is a palindromeMisc :Interesting Facts about Bitwise Operators in COptimization Techniques | Set 1 (Modulus)What are the differences between bitwise and logical AND operators in C/C++?Bit Fields in CC++ bitset and its applicationC++ bitset interesting factsBuiltin functions of GCC compilerBits manipulation (Important tactics)Bit Tricks for Competitive ProgrammingQuick Links :‘Practice Problems’ on Bit Magic‘Quiz’ on Bit Magic‘Videos’ on Bit MagicIf you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using write.geeksforgeeks.org or mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
