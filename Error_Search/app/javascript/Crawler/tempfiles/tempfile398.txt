JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article List of all Java KeywordsDifficulty Level : BasicLast Updated : 30 Sep, 2021Keywords or Reserved words are the words in a language that are used for some internal process or represent some predefined actions. These words are therefore not allowed to use as variable names or objects. If we do we will get a compile-time error as shown below as follows:Illustration:// Java Program to Illustrate What If We Don't // have knowledge of Keywords(Reserve Words) // Importing input output classes import java.io.*; // Main class class GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Print statement System.out.println(super); } }Output:Java contains a list of keywords or reserved words which ae also highlighted with different colors be it an IDE or editor in order to segregate the differences between flexible words and reserved words. They are listed below in the table with primary action associated with them. S.NoKeywordUsage1.abstractSpecifies that a class or method will be implemented later, in a subclass 2.assertAssert describes a predicate placed in a java program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place.3. booleanA data type that can hold True and False values only 4.breakA control statement for breaking out of loops.5.byteA data type that can hold 8-bit data values 6.caseUsed in switch statements to mark blocks of text7.catchCatches exceptions generated by try statements8.char A data type that can hold unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters9.classDeclares a new class10.continueSends control back outside a loop 11.defaultSpecifies the default block of code in a switch statement12.doStarts a do-while loop13.doubleA data type that can hold 64-bit floating-point numbers14.elseIndicates alternative branches in an if statement 15.enumA Java keyword is used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class.16.extendsIndicates that a class is derived from another class or interface 17.finalIndicates that a variable holds a constant value or that a method will not be overridden18.finallyIndicates a block of code in a try-catch structure that will always be executed19.floatA data type that holds a 32-bit floating-point number 20.forUsed to start a for loop21.ifTests a true/false expression and branches accordingly22.implementsSpecifies that a class implements an interface 23.import References other classes24.instanceofIndicates whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements an interface 25.intA data type that can hold a 32-bit signed integer 26.interfaceDeclares an interface27.longA data type that holds a 64-bit integer28.nativeSpecifies that a method is implemented with native (platform-specific) code 29.newCreates new objects 30.nullIndicates that a reference does not refer to anything 31.packageDeclares a Java package32.privateAn access specifier indicating that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class it’s declared in33.protectedAn access specifier indicating that a method or variable may only be accessed in the class it’s declared in (or a subclass of the class it’s declared in or other classes in the same package)34.publicAn access specifier used for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables indicating that an item is accessible throughout the application (or where the class that defines it is accessible)35.returnSends control and possibly a return value back from a called method 36.shortA data type that can hold a 16-bit integer 37staticIndicates that a variable or method is a class method (rather than being limited to one particular object)38.strictfpA Java keyword is used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating-point calculations to ensure portability.39.superRefers to a class’s base class (used in a method or class constructor) 40.switchA statement that executes code based on a test value 41.synchronizedSpecifies critical sections or methods in multithreaded code42.thisRefers to the current object in a method or constructor 43.throw Creates an exception 44.throwsIndicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method 45.transientSpecifies that a variable is not part of an object’s persistent state46.tryStarts a block of code that will be tested for exceptions 47.voidSpecifies that a method does not have a return value48.volatileThis indicates that a variable may change asynchronously49.whileStarts a while loopNote: The keywords const and goto are reserved, even they are not currently in use.constReserved for future usegotoReserved for future usetrue, false and null look like keywords, but in actual they are literals. However they still can’t be used as identifiers in a program.Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.
