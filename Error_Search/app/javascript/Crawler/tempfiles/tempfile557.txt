All we need to do is put related classes into packages. After that, we can simply write an import class from existing packages and use it in our program. A package is a container of a group of related classes where some classes are accessible are exposed and others are kept for internal purposes. We can reuse existing classes from the packages as many times as we need them in our program. Package names and directory structure are closely relatedWays: There are two types of packages in java:User-defined Package (Create Your Own Package’s)Built-in packages are packages from the java application programming interface that are the packages from Java API for example such as swing, util, net, io, AWT, lang, javax, etc.In this article, we will see How To Create A Package In Java?. A package is a group of similar types of Classes, Interfaces, and sub-packages. We use Packages in order to avoid name conflicts. Syntax: To import a packageimport package.name.*;Example: To import a packageJava// Java Program to Import a package // Importing java utility packageimport java.util.*; // Main Classclass GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Scanner to take input from the user object Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in); String userName; // Display message // Enter Your Name And Press Enter System.out.println("Enter You Name"); // Reading the integer age entered using // nextInt() method userName = myObj.nextLine(); // Print and display System.out.println("Your Name IS : " + userName); }}OutputEnter You Name Your Name IS : 0Here In The Above Program, ‘java.util’ package is imported and run for a simple program. These are called as Inbuilt Packages. Now in order to create a package in java follow the certain steps as described below: First We Should Choose A Name For The Package We Are Going To Create And Include. The package command In The first line in the java program source code.Further inclusion of classes, interfaces, annotation types, etc that is required in the package can be made in the package. For example, the below single statement creates a package name called “FirstPackage”.Syntax: To declare the name of the package to be created. The package statement simply defines in which package the classes defined belong.package FirstPackage ;Implementation: To Create a Class Inside A Package First Declare The Package Name As The First Statement Of Our Program.Then We Can Include A Class As A Part Of The Package.Example 1: Java// Name of package to be createdpackage FirstPackage; // Class in which the above created package belong toclass Welcome { // main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Print statement for the successful // compilation and execution of the program System.out.println( "This Is The First Program Geeks For Geeks.."); }}So Inorder to generate the above-desired output first do use the commands as specified use the following specified commandsProcedure: 1. To generate the output from the above program Command: javac Welcome.java 2. The Above Command Will Give Us Welcome.class File. Command: javac -d . Welcome.java 3. So This Command Will Create a New Folder Called FirstPackage. Command: java FirstPackage.Welcome Output: The Above Will Give The Final Output Of The Example ProgramThis Is The Output Of The Above ProgramExample 2: Java// Name of package to be createdpackage data; // Class to which the above package belongspublic class Demo { // Member functions of the class- 'Demo' // Method 1 - To show() public void show() { // Print message System.out.println("Hi Everyone"); } // Method 2 - To show() public void view() { // Print message System.out.println("Hello"); }}Again, in order to generate the above-desired output first do use the commands as specified use the following specified commandsProcedure: 1. To generate the output from the above program Command: javac Demo.java 2. This Command Will Give Us a Class File Command: javac -d . Demo.java 3. So This Command Will Create a New Folder Called data. Note: In data Demo.java & Demo.class File should be present Example 3: Data will be tried to be accessed now from another program Java// Name of the packageimport data.*; // Class to which the package belongsclass ncj { // main driver method public static void main(String arg[]) { // Creating an object of Demo class Demo d = new Demo(); // Calling the functions show() and view() // using the object of Demo class d.show(); d.view(); }}Again the following commands will be used in order to generate the output as first a file ill be created ‘ncj.java’ outside the data directory.Command: javac Demo.java The Above Command Will Give us a class file that is non-runnable so we do need a command further to make it an executable run file. Command: java ncj // To Run This File Output: Generated on the terminal after the above command Is executed Hi Everyone Hello Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.
