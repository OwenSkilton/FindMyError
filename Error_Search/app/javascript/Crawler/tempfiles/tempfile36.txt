The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.Topics :IntroductionDesign and ImplementationStandard ProblemsOperations on StackMiscQuick LinksIntroduction :Introduction to StackStack in C++ STLStack Class in JavaStack in PythonStack in C#Design and Implementation :Implement Queue using StacksDesign and Implement Special Stack Data Structure | Added Space Optimized VersionImplement two stacks in an arrayImplement Stack using QueuesDesign a stack with operations on middle elementHow to efficiently implement k stacks in a single array?How to create mergable stack?Design a stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra spaceImplement a stack using single queueHow to implement stack using priority queue or heap?Create a customized data structure which evaluates functions in O(1)Implement Stack and Queue using DequeStandard Problems based on Stack :Infix to Postfix Conversion using StackPrefix to Infix ConversionPrefix to Postfix ConversionPostfix to Prefix ConversionPostfix to InfixConvert Infix To Prefix NotationThe Stock Span ProblemCheck for balanced parentheses in an expressionNext Greater ElementNext Greater Frequency ElementNumber of NGEs to the rightMaximum product of indexes of next greater on left and rightThe Celebrity ProblemExpression EvaluationArithmetic Expression EvalutionEvaluation of Postfix ExpressionIterative Tower of HanoiPrint next greater number of Q queriesOperations on Stack :Reverse a stack using recursionSort a stack using recursionSort a stack using a temporary stackReverse a stack without using extra space in O(n)Delete middle element of a stackSorting array using StacksDelete array elements which are smaller than next or become smallerCheck if a queue can be sorted into another queue using a stackReverse individual wordsCount subarrays where second highest lie before highestCheck if an array is stack sortableMisc :Iterative Postorder Traversal | Set 1 (Using Two Stacks)Iterative Postorder Traversal | Set 2 (Using One Stack)Merge Overlapping IntervalsLargest Rectangular Area in a Histogram | Set 2Print ancestors of a given binary tree node without recursionReverse a string using stackProgram for Tower of HanoiFind maximum depth of nested parenthesis in a stringFind maximum of minimum for every window size in a given arrayLength of the longest valid substringIterative Depth First Traversal of GraphMinimum number of bracket reversals needed to make an expression balancedExpression contains redundant bracket or notIdentify and mark unmatched parenthesis in an expressionCheck if two expressions with brackets are sameFind index of closing bracket for a given opening bracket in an expressionCheck for balanced parentheses in an expressionBalanced expression with replacementCheck if a given array can represent Preorder Traversal of Binary Search TreeForm minimum number from given sequenceFind if an expression has duplicate parenthesis or notFind maximum difference between nearest left and right smaller elementsFind next Smaller of next Greater in an arrayFind maximum sum possible equal sum of three stacksCount natural numbers whose all permutation are greater than that numberDelete consecutive same words in a sequenceDecode a string recursively encoded as count followed by substringBubble sort using two StacksPattern Occurrences : Stack Implementation JavaIterative method to find ancestors of a given binary treeStack Permutations (Check if an array is stack permutation of other)Tracking current Maximum Element in a StackCheck mirror in n-ary treeReverse a number using stackReversing the first K elements of a QueueReversing a QueueCheck if stack elements are pairwise consecutiveSpaghetti StackInterleave the first half of the queue with second halfRemove brackets from an algebraic string containing + and – operatorsGrowable array based stackRange Queries for Longest Correct Bracket SubsequenceQuick Links :‘Practice Problems’ on Stack‘Videos’ on Stack‘Quizzes’ on StackGeeksforgeeks Courses:1.
