It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.Let a hash function H(x) maps the value at the index x%10 in an Array. For example if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or Hash table respectively.Recent Articles on HashingTopic
