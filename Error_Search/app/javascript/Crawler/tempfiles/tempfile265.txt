It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.Recent Articles on C !C Output & Multiple Choice QuestionsBasics, Variable Declaration, Definition and Scope, Data Types, Storage Classes, Input/Output, Operators, Preprocessor,
