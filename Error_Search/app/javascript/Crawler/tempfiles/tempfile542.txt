Notes provided by GeeksforGeeks comprise of all the formulae, theorems, concepts, proofs descriptions, definitions, graphs, that a student needs to practice and score good marks in their board examinations.Chapter 1: Real NumbersThe chapter Real numbers include both irrational and rational numbers with all natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, etc and discuss their characteristics.Euclid’s Division Algorithm Fundamental Theorem of ArithmeticHCF and LCMDecimal Expansion of Rational NumbersChapter 2: PolynomialsPolynomials are algebraic expressions that consist of coefficients and variables or indeterminate. An arithmetic operation such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and also positive integer exponents for polynomial expressions but not division by variable can be performed on polynomials.Geometrical meaning of the Zeroes of polynomialRelationship between Zeroes and coefficients of a polynomialDivision Algorithm for polynomialsChapter 3: Pair of Linear Equations in Two VariablesAn equation of the form ax+by+c, where a, b and c are real numbers and a, b are not equal to zero, is termed as the linear equation in two variables. However, in a pair of linear equations in two variables, there exist two such equations whose solution is a point on the line denoting the equation.Graphical methods of Solving a Pair of Linear EquationsAlgebraic methods of Solving a Pair of Linear EquationsEquation Reducible to a Pair of linear equations in two variablesChapter 4: Quadratic EquationsThe degree 2 polynomial equations in one variable are called the Quadratic equations. The general form of a quadratic equation is ax2 + bx + c where a, b, c, ∈ R and a ≠ 0, where ‘a’ is called the leading coefficient and ‘c’ is called the absolute term of the complete equation. Quadratic EquationsSolution of a Quadratic equation by different methodsRoots of a Quadratic EquationChapter 5: Arithmetic ProgressionsThe arithmetic progression is explained as the sequence of numbers where the difference between any two subsequent numbers is a constant. Introduction to Arithmetic ProgressionsCommon difference and Nth termSum of First n TermsChapter 6: Triangles Geometrically, a triangle is defined as a three-sided polygon consist of three edges and three vertices. The most important and applied property of a triangle is its Angle sum property which means the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees only.Similar TrianglesPythagoras Theorem and its ConverseThales’s TheoremCriteria for Similarity of TrianglesChapter 7: Coordinate GeometryCoordinate Geometry is defined as the link between geometry and algebra using graphs along with the curves and lines. In this way, it provides geometric aspects in Algebra and leads to solve geometric problems. Coordinate GeometryDistance formulaSection formulaMid-point FormulaArea of a TriangleChapter 8: Introduction to TrigonometryTrigonometry can be defined as calculations including in triangles to study its lengths, heights and angles. Trigonometry and its functions have an enormous number of uses in our daily life.Introduction to Trigonometric Ratios of a TriangleTrigonometric Ratios of Some Specific AnglesReciprocal of Trigonometric RatiosTrigonometric IdentitiesChapter 9: Some Applications of TrigonometryTrigonometry has a lot of practical applications in our real-life. This part of geometry discusses the line of sight, angle of deviation, angle of elevation, and angle of depression. Using trigonometry and trigonometric ratios the height of a building, or a mountain, from a viewpoint and the elevation angle can be determined easily.Heights and DistancesChapter 10: CirclesA circle is a geometrical shape that is defined as the locus of points that move in a plane so that its distance from a fixed point is always constant. This fixed point is the Centre of the circle while the fixed distance from it is called the radius of the circle. Tangent to a circleTangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contactNumber of Tangents from a point on a circleLengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal Chapter 11: ConstructionsConstruction helps to understand the approach to construct different types of triangles for different given conditions using a ruler and compass of required measurements.Division of Line Segment in Given RatioChapter 12: Areas Related to CirclesArea related to circles are the amount of space covered by a circle, which is defined in different ways. Some areas related to a circle are, area of the circle itself, Area of the sector, area of the segment, area of the triangle or parallelogram, etc located in a circle.Perimeter of circular figures, Areas of sector and segment of a circle & Areas of combination of plane figuresChapter 13: Surface Areas and VolumesSurface area and volume are the measures calculated for a three-dimensional geometrical shape like a cube, cuboid, sphere, etc. The surface area of any given object is the area occupied by the surface of the object while volume is the amount of space available in an object.Surface Areas and VolumesVolumes of a combination of solidsConversion of solids Frustum of a ConeChapter 14: StatisticsStatistics is the study of the representation, collection, interpretation, analysis, presentation, and organization of data. In other words, it is a mathematical way to collect, summarize data. The representation of data differently along with the frequency distribution. Step deviation Method for Finding the Mean with ExamplesMean, Median, and Mode of a grouped dataCumulative Frequency CurveChapter 15: ProbabilityThe Probability in this class includes basic probability theory, which is also used in the probability distribution, to learn the possibility of outcomes for a random experiment and to find the probability of a single event to occur, when the total number of possible outcomes.Probability TheoryDependent and Independent EventsMy Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousCBSE Class 10 Maths NotesNext GeeksforGeeks SchoolRecommended ArticlesPage :CBSE Class 9 Maths Notes19, Apr 21CBSE Class 12 Maths Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Class 11 Maths Notes03, Jun 21CBSE Class 8 Maths Notes19, Apr 21CBSE Physics Class 8 Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Class 9 Physics Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Notes for Class 10 Physics11, Nov 21CBSE Class 11 Physics Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Class 10 Chemistry Notes09, Jan 22CBSE Class 9 Chemistry Notes09, Jan 22CBSE Class 8 Chemistry Notes09, Jan 22CBSE Class 10 Maths Term 1 Exam 2021 Paper Analysis Standard27, Dec 21CBSE Class 10 Term 1 Maths Answer Key 2021 Basic Paper10, Jan 22CBSE Class 8 Maths Formulas08, Jan 22CBSE Class 9 Maths Formulas09, Jan 22Polynomials in One Variable - Polynomials | Class 9 Maths12, Jan 21Point-slope Form - Straight Lines | Class 11 Maths03, Nov 20Mathematical Operations on Algebraic Expressions - Algebraic Expressions and Identities | Class 8 Maths16, Nov 20Theorem - The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal - Circles | Class 10 Maths24, Oct 20Standard Algebraic Identities | Class 9 Maths10, Feb 21Mid Point Theorem - Quadrilaterals | Class 9 Maths25, Oct 20Graphing slope-intercept equations - Straight Lines | Class 11 Maths04, Nov 20Arithmetic Progression - Common difference and Nth term | Class 10 Maths06, Oct 20Arithmetic Progression – Sum of First n Terms | Class 10 Maths02, Oct 20Article Contributed By :GeeksforGeeksVote for difficultyEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertArticle Tags :Class 10School LearningSchool MathematicsReport IssueWriting code in comment?
