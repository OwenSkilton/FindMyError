FileStreams in JavaDelete a file using JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article File Permissions in JavaDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 03 Jan, 2022Java provides a number of method calls to check and change the permission of a file, such as a read-only file can be changed to have permissions to write. File permissions are required to be changed when the user wants to restrict the operations permissible on a file. For example, file permission can be changed from write to read-only because the user no longer wants to edit the file. Checking the Current File PermissionsA file can be in any combination of the following permissible permissions: 1. Executable: Tests whether the application can execute the file denoted by this abstract path name. Syntax: public boolean canExecute()Returns: It returns true if and only if the abstract pathname exists and the application is allowed to execute the file2. Readable: Tests whether the application can read the file denoted by this abstract path name. Syntax: public boolean canRead()Returns: It returns true if and only if the file specified by this abstract pathname exists and can be read by the application; false otherwise3. Writable: Tests whether the application can modify the file denoted by this abstract path name. Syntax:public boolean canWrite()Returns: It returns true if and only if the file system actually contains a file denoted by this abstract pathname and the application is allowed to write to the file; false otherwise.For example, a file can be readable and writable but not executable. Here’s a Java program to get the current permissions associated with a file.Java// Java program to check the current file permissions. import java.io.*; public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { // creating a file instance File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Mayank\\Desktop\\1.txt"); // check if the file exists boolean exists = file.exists(); if (exists == true) { // printing the permissions associated with the // file System.out.println("Executable: " + file.canExecute()); System.out.println("Readable: " + file.canRead()); System.out.println("Writable: " + file.canWrite()); } else { System.out.println("File not found."); } }}Output Executable: true Readable: true Writable: trueChanging File PermissionsA file can have any combination of the following permissions: ExecutableReadableWritableHere are methods to change the permissions associated with a file: 1. setExecutableA convenience method to set the owner’s execute permission for this abstract path name. Syntax:public boolean setExecutable(boolean executable)Parameters: executable – If true, sets the access permission to allow execute operations; if false to disallow execute operations.Returns: It returns true if and only if the operation succeeded. The operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If the executable is false and the underlying file system does not implement an execute permission, then the operation will fail. 2. setReadable: A convenience method to set the owner’s read permission for this abstract path name. Syntax:public boolean setReadable(boolean readable)Parameters: readable – If true, sets the access permission to allow read operations; if false to disallow read operationsReturns: It returns true if and only if the operation succeeded. The operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change the access permissions of this abstract path name. If readable is false and the underlying file system does not implement a read permission, then the operation will fail.3. setWritable : A convenience method to set the owner’s write permission for this abstract path name. Syntax:public boolean setWritable(boolean writable)Parameters: writable – If true, sets the access permission to allow write operations; if false to disallow write operationsReturns: It returns true if and only if the operation succeeded.The operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change the access permissions of this abstract path name.Java// Java program to change the file permissions import java.io.*; public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { // creating a new file instance File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Mayank\\Desktop\\1.txt"); // check if file exists boolean exists = file.exists(); if (exists == true) { // changing the file permissions file.setExecutable(true); file.setReadable(true); file.setWritable(false); System.out.println("File permissions changed."); // printing the permissions associated with the // file currently System.out.println("Executable: " + file.canExecute()); System.out.println("Readable: " + file.canRead()); System.out.println("Writable: " + file.canWrite()); } else { System.out.println("File not found."); } }}Output File permissions changed.
