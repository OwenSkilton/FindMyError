The following chapter-wise notes provided by GeeksforGeeks are equipped with various shortcut techniques and step-by-step methods in order to understand and solve the problems in a better way.Chapter 1: Rational NumbersAny number that can be described in p/q form where q is not equal to zero is called a rational number. A rational number is a kind of real number. Or in other words, Any fraction with non-zero denominators is a rational number.Rational NumbersRepresentation of rational numbers on the number lineRational Numbers Between Two Rational NumbersReducing Equations to Simpler FormChapter 2: Linear Equations in One VariableThe linear equation in one variable is an expression that is denoted as ax+b = 0, where a and b are any two integers, and x is a variable and consists of only one solution.Linear Equations in One VariableSolve Linear Equations with Variable on both SidesSolving Equations which have Linear Expressions on one Side and Numbers on the other Side Reducing Equations to Simpler FormChapter 3: Understanding QuadrilateralsGeometrically, a quadrilateral is defined as a closed, 2-D shape that has four linear sides. The different types of quadrilaterals according to their number of edges and vertices are square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezium, kite, rhombus.Polygons and its typesMeasures of the Exterior Angles of a PolygonRectangle, Square, Rhombus, ParallelogramSome Special ParallelogramsChapter 4: Practical GeometryThe chapter practical geometry simply means is to construct geometrical figures like squares, triangles, quadrilateral, etc. using a scale, and compass when different parameters of it are known. Construction of a QuadrilateralChapter 5: Data HandlingData handling refers to the process of collecting, organizing, and presenting any raw information in a way that is helpful to others like in graphs or charts, etc.Data HandlingOrganizing DataGrouping DataPie ChartChance and ProbabilityChapter 6: Squares and Square RootsBoth the concepts of squares and square roots are opposite to each other. As the squares are used for the numbers come after multiplying the number by itself. However, the square root of a number is the value obtained when multiplied by itself to give the original value. For instance, the square of 5 is 25 and the square root of 25 is 5.Squares and Square RootsChapter 7: Cubes and Cube rootsAgain both the concepts of cubes and cube roots are opposite to each other. As the cubes are used for the numbers come after multiplying the number by itself thrice. However, the cube root of a number is the value obtained when multiplied by itself thrice to give the original value. For instance, the cube of 5 is 125 and the cube root of 125 is 5.Cubes and Cube RootsChapter 8: Comparing QuantitiesThe chapter Comparing quantities is the most basic everyday-life application of Mathematics that deals with quantities. This includes the concepts like percentage, ratio, market price, selling price, cost price, discount and discount price, profit or loss, interest, etc. Ratios and PercentagesPercent Change & Discounts Prices Related to Buying and Selling (Profit and Loss)Compound InterestCompound Interest FormulaSales Tax, Value Added Tax, and Goods and Services Tax Chapter 9: Algebraic Expressions and IdentitiesThe chapter Algebraic Expressions and Identities provides information about the basics of monomials, binomials, and polynomials in an algebraic expression. Algebraic expressionsLike and Unlike Algebraic TermsMathematical Operations on Algebraic ExpressionsTypes of PolynomialsMultiplying PolynomialsStandard Algebraic IdentitiesChapter 10: Visualising Solid ShapesVisualizing Solid Shapes is a concept that provides the understanding of different solids shapes when visualized in different dimensions and various terms used to describe their properties.Visualizing Solid ShapesMapping Space Around UsChapter 11: MensurationMensuration is the chapter that deals with the measurement or the calculations related to determining the area, perimeter, volume of various geometrical figures like square, cube, rectangle, cuboid, cylinder, and triangle, etc. Introduction to MensurationArea of TrapeziumArea of PolygonsArea of General QuadrilateralSurface Area of Cube, Cuboid, and CylinderVolume of Cube, Cuboid, and CylinderVolume and CapacityChapter 12: Exponents and PowersThe chapter Exponents and powers cover the primary concepts such as laws of exponents and their applications. The chapter deals with the problems using the applications of power to write large numbers in exponents and vice-versa.Negative ExponentsLaws of Exponents & Use of Exponents to Express Small Numbers in Standard FormChapter 13: Direct and Inverse ProportionsThis chapter gives a detailed explanation of inverse and direct proportions through problems discussed in two exercises. In which Exercise 13.1 contains a problem to determine the direct proportions between any quantity and Exercise 13.2 deals with the questions from the indirect inverse.Direct and Inverse Proportions Chapter 14: FactorizationThis chapter comprises the problems on the factors of natural numbers and algebraic expressions, factorization by regrouping terms, factorization using identities, division of algebraic expressions. Introduction to factorizationDivision of Algebraic ExpressionsChapter 15: Introduction to GraphsThis chapter is all about the basic understanding of the graphs, kinds of graphs, etc. Lately, this chapter provided an emphasis on the construction of different types of graphs and their applications.Introduction to GraphsLinear GraphsChapter 16: Playing with NumbersAll the above-mentioned chapters basically helped to learn about various kinds of numbers and their different properties likewise in this chapter the concept of numbers is discussed in a more general way.
