GeeksforGeeks provided the following chapter-wise notes that contain numbers of theorems with their proper explanations, formulae with their applications, and graphs that need to accelerate students’ knack of practicing problems and boost their interest to pursue maths in higher classes.Chapter 1: Number SystemsThe numeral or number system is the combination of natural, integers, rational, irrational, and real numbers. This lesson covers the entire concepts of the numeral system and its types, representation on the number line, laws of rational exponents, and integral powers.Number SystemDecimal Expansion of Real NumbersOperations on Real numbersLaws of exponents for real numbersnth roots of a numberChapter 2: PolynomialsPolynomial is an expression that comprises variables and coefficients which involves the operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables.Polynomials in One VariableZeroes of a polynomialRemainder TheoremMultiplying PolynomialsAlgebraic Identities of PolynomialsStandard Algebraic IdentitiesChapter 3: Coordinate GeometryThe coordinate geometry is a part of geometry where the position of the points on the plane is described with the help of an ordered pair of numbers called coordinates.Cartesian Coordinate SystemCartesian PlaneChapter 4: Linear Equations in Two Variables Any equation which can be defined in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables.Linear Equations and their solutionsGraph of a linear equation in two variablesEquations of Lines Parallel to the x-axis and y-axisChapter 5: Introduction to Euclid’s GeometryEuclidean geometry is the branch of geometry that deals with the study of geometrical shapes and figures based on different axioms and theorems. This study basically provides a brief explanation for flat surfaces.Euclid’s Definitions, Axioms, and PostulatesEquivalent version of Euclid’s Fifth postulate Chapter 6: Lines and AnglesIn geometry, Lines and Angles are defined as figures that are made up of infinite points extending indefinitely in both directions. Lines are straight and have length and breadth, while an angle is a figure from which two rays emerge from a common point.Basic terms and definitionsPairs of Angles Lines parallel to the same line and Angle Sum PropertyChapter 7: TrianglesGeometrically, a triangle is defined as a three-sided polygon consist of three edges and three vertices. The most important and applied property of a triangle is its Angle sum property which means the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees only.Congruence of TrianglesProperties of trianglesAngle Sum Property of a TriangleInequalities in a triangleTheorem – Angle opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equalChapter 8: QuadrilateralA quadrilateral is a plane geometrical figure which has four sides and has four corners or vertices. Typically, quadrilaterals are rectangle, square, trapezoid, and kite or irregular and uncharacterized figures with four sides.Angle sum property of a quadrilateralTypes of quadrilateralProperties of ParallelogramsMidPoint TheoremRhombusKite – QuadrilateralsChapter 9: Areas of Parallelograms and TrianglesThe area of a plane figure is described as the amount of the planar surface covered by a closed geometric figure like rectangle, square, etc. The area of a parallelogram is equal to the product of its Area of 2D ShapesChapter 10: Circles A circle is a geometrical shape which is defined as the locus of points that moves in a plane so that its distance from a fixed point is always constant. This fixed point is the Centre of the circle while the fixed distance from it is called the radius of the circle. Circles and its Related TermsCircle TheoremsTheorem – There is one and only one circle passing through three given non-collinear pointsTheorem – The sum of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180°Chapter 11: Constructions Construction helps to understand the approach to construct different types of triangles for different given conditions using a ruler and compass of required measurements.Basics ConstructionSome construction of trianglesChapter 12: Heron’s FormulaIn this chapter, a formula called Heron’s formula is introduced which helps to determine the area of the triangle when three sides of its being given. The application of this formula also helps to find the area of other different polygons also.Heron’s FormulaApplications of Heron’s FormulaChapter 13: Surface Areas and VolumesSurface area and volume are the measures calculated for a three-dimensional geometrical shape like a cube, cuboid, sphere etc. The surface area of any given object is the area occupied by the surface of the object while volume is the amount of space available in an object.Volumes of Cubes and CuboidsChapter 14: Statistics Statistics is the study of the representation, collection, interpretation, analysis, presentation, and organization of data. In other words, it is a mathematical way to collect, summarize data. The representation of data differently along with the frequency distribution. Presentation of dataGraphical representation of DataBar graphs and HistogramsCentral TendencyMean, Median, Mode, and RangeChapter 15: ProbabilityThe Probability in this class includes basic probability theory, which is also used in the probability distribution, to learn the possibility of outcomes for a random experiment and to find the probability of a single event to occur, when the total number of possible outcomes.Experimental ProbabilityEmpirical ProbabilityPractice Problems on ProbabilityMy Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousNumber System in MathsNext GeeksforGeeks SchoolRecommended ArticlesPage :CBSE Class 12 Maths Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Class 11 Maths Notes03, Jun 21CBSE Class 8 Maths Notes19, Apr 21CBSE Class 10 Maths Notes20, Apr 21CBSE Physics Class 8 Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Class 9 Physics Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Notes for Class 10 Physics11, Nov 21CBSE Class 11 Physics Notes11, Nov 21CBSE Class 10 Chemistry Notes09, Jan 22CBSE Class 9 Chemistry Notes09, Jan 22CBSE Class 8 Chemistry Notes09, Jan 22CBSE Class 10 Maths Term 1 Exam 2021 Paper Analysis Standard27, Dec 21CBSE Class 10 Term 1 Maths Answer Key 2021 Basic Paper10, Jan 22CBSE Class 8 Maths Formulas08, Jan 22CBSE Class 9 Maths Formulas09, Jan 22Polynomials in One Variable - Polynomials | Class 9 Maths12, Jan 21Point-slope Form - Straight Lines | Class 11 Maths03, Nov 20Mathematical Operations on Algebraic Expressions - Algebraic Expressions and Identities | Class 8 Maths16, Nov 20Theorem - The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal - Circles | Class 10 Maths24, Oct 20Standard Algebraic Identities | Class 9 Maths10, Feb 21Mid Point Theorem - Quadrilaterals | Class 9 Maths25, Oct 20Graphing slope-intercept equations - Straight Lines | Class 11 Maths04, Nov 20Mensuration - Volume of Cube, Cuboid, and Cylinder | Class 8 Maths23, Oct 20Arithmetic Progression - Common difference and Nth term | Class 10 Maths06, Oct 20Article Contributed By :GeeksforGeeksVote for difficultyEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertArticle Tags :Class 9School LearningSchool MathematicsReport IssueWriting code in comment?
