JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Java Ternary Operator with ExamplesDifficulty Level : BasicLast Updated : 13 Jul, 2021Operators constitute the basic building block to any programming language. Java too provides many types of operators which can be used according to the need to perform various calculation and functions be it logical, arithmetic, relational etc. They are classified based on the functionality they provide. Here are a few types: Arithmetic OperatorsUnary OperatorsAssignment OperatorRelational OperatorsLogical OperatorsTernary OperatorBitwise OperatorsShift OperatorsThis article explains all that one needs to know regarding the Ternary Operator. Ternary OperatorJava ternary operator is the only conditional operator that takes three operands. It’s a one-liner replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in Java programming. We can use the ternary operator in place of if-else conditions or even switch conditions using nested ternary operators. Although it follows the same algorithm as of if-else statement, the conditional operator takes less space and helps to write the if-else statements in the shortest way possible. Syntax: variable = Expression1 ? Expression2: Expression3If operates similarly to that of the if-else statement as in Exression2 is executed if Expression1 is true else Expression3 is executed. if(Expression1) { variable = Expression2; } else { variable = Expression3; }Example: num1 = 10; num2 = 20; res=(num1>num2) ? (num1+num2):(num1-num2) Since num1<num2, the second operation is performed res = num1-num2 = -10Flowchart of Ternary Operation Example 1: Java// Java program to find largest among two// numbers using ternary operator import java.io.*; class Ternary { public static void main(String[] args) { // variable declaration int n1 = 5, n2 = 10, max; System.out.println("First num: " + n1); System.out.println("Second num: " + n2); // Largest among n1 and n2 max = (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2; // Print the largest number System.out.println("Maximum is = " + max); }}Output: First num: 5 Second num: 10 Maximum is = 10 Example 2: Java// Java code to illustrate ternary operator import java.io.*; class Ternary { public static void main(String[] args) { // variable declaration int n1 = 5, n2 = 10, res; System.out.println("First num: " + n1); System.out.println("Second num: " + n2); // Performing ternary operation res = (n1 > n2) ? (n1 + n2) : (n1 - n2); // Print the largest number System.out.println("Result = " + res); }}Output: First num: 5 Second num: 10 Result = -5 Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.
