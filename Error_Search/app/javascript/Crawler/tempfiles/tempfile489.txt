There are two-dimensional forms and three-dimensional shapes in Euclidean geometry. Flat shapes are two shapes in plane geometry that include triangles, squares, rectangles, and circles. 3D forms such as a square, cuboid, cone, and so on are also known as solids in solid geometry. The fundamental geometry is based on points, lines, and planes, as described in coordinate geometry.The various forms of shapes in geometry help us understand the shapes we see in our daily lives. We can measure the field, circumference, and volume of shapes using geometric principles.Table of ContentPlane GeometrySolid GeometryPlane GeometryPlane geometry is concerned with platforms that can be drawn on paper. Lines, circles, and triangles in two dimensions are examples. Plane geometry is another name for two-dimensional geometry. All two-dimensional figures have only two dimensions: length and width. It does not take into account the depth of the shapes. Plane figures have squares, triangles, rectangles, circles, and so on. Any of the most essential terms in plane geometry are described here in the below articles:Polygons and its typesMeasures of the Exterior Angles of a PolygonRectangle, Square, Rhombus, ParallelogramSome Special ParallelogramsBasic terms and definitionsPairs of AnglesParallel lines and a transversalLines parallel to the same line and Angle Sum PropertyProperties of trianglesAngle Sum Property of a TriangleInequalities in a triangleTheorem – Angle opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equalAngle sum property of a quadrilateralTypes of quadrilateralProperties of ParallelogramsMidPoint TheoremKite – QuadrilateralsArea of 2D ShapesFigures on the same base and between the same parallelsCircles and its Related TermsCircle TheoremsTheorem – There is one and only one circle passing through three given non-collinear pointsTheorem – The sum of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180°Basic ConstructionConstruction of a QuadrilateralEuclid’s Definitions, Axioms, and PostulatesEquivalent version of Euclid’s Fifth postulateSimilar TrianglesPythagoras Theorem and it’s ConverseThales’s TheoremCriteria for Similarity of TrianglesSolid GeometrySolid geometry is concerned with three-dimensional structures such as cubes, prisms, cylinders, and spheres. It is concerned with the figure’s three dimensions, which are length, width, and height. However, certain solids do not have faces (e.g. sphere). The analysis of three dimensions in Euclidean space is known as solid geometry. The structures of our environment are three-dimensional. Both three-dimensional shapes are created by rotating two-dimensional shapes. Faces, corners, and vertices are essential characteristics of 3D forms.
