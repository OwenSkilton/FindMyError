JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Java if-else statement with ExamplesDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 17 Feb, 2021Decision Making in Java helps to write decision driven statements and execute a particular set of code based on certain conditions.The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it won’t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.Syntax:if (condition) { // Executes this block if // condition is true } else { // Executes this block if // condition is false }Working of if-else statementsControl falls into the if block.The flow jumps to Condition.Condition is tested.If Condition yields true, goto Step 4.If Condition yields false, goto Step 5.The if-block or the body inside the if is executed.The else block or the body inside the else is executed.Flow exits the if-else block.Flowchart if-else:Example 1:// Java program to illustrate if-else statement class IfElseDemo { public static void main(String args[]) { int i = 20; if (i < 15) System.out.println("i is smaller than 15"); else System.out.println("i is greater than 15"); System.out.println("Outside if-else block"); }}Output:i is greater than 15 Outside if-else block Dry-Running Example 1:1. Program starts. 2. i is initialized to 20. 3. if-condition is checked. 20<15, yields false. 4. flow enters the else block. 4.a) "i is greater than 15" is printed 5. "Outside if-else block" is printed. Example 2:// Java program to illustrate if-else statement class IfElseDemo { public static void main(String args[]) { String str = "geeksforgeeks"; if (str == "geeks") System.out.println("Hello geek"); else System.out.println("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks"); }}Output:Welcome to GeeksforGeeks Related Articles:Decision Making in JavaJava if statement with ExamplesJava if-else-if ladder with ExamplesSwitch Statement in JavaBreak statement in Javareturn keyword in JavaAttention reader!
