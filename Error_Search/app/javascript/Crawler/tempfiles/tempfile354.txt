JavaImprove Article Save Article Like Article Break statement in JavaDifficulty Level : EasyLast Updated : 17 Feb, 2021Break Statement is a loop control statement that is used to terminate the loop. As soon as the break statement is encountered from within a loop, the loop iterations stop there, and control returns from the loop immediately to the first statement after the loop. Syntax: break;Basically, break statements are used in situations when we are not sure about the actual number of iterations for the loop or we want to terminate the loop based on some condition. Break: In Java, the break is majorly used for: Terminate a sequence in a switch statement (discussed above).To exit a loop.Used as a “civilized” form of goto.Using break to exit a LoopUsing break, we can force immediate termination of a loop, bypassing the conditional expression and any remaining code in the body of the loop. Note: Break, when used inside a set of nested loops, will only break out of the innermost loop. Example:Java// Java program to illustrate using// break to exit a loopclass BreakLoopDemo { public static void main(String args[]) { // Initially loop is set to run from 0-9 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // terminate loop when i is 5. if (i == 5) break; System.out.println("i: " + i); } System.out.println("Loop complete."); }}Output: i: 0 i: 1 i: 2 i: 3 i: 4 Loop complete.Using break as a Form of GotoJava does not have a goto statement because it provides a way to branch in an arbitrary and unstructured manner. Java uses the label. A Label is used to identifies a block of code. Syntax: label: { statement1; statement2; statement3; . . }Now, break statement can be use to jump out of target block. Note: You cannot break to any label which is not defined for an enclosing block. Syntax: break label;Example: Java// Java program to illustrate // using break with gotoclass BreakLabelDemo { public static void main(String args[]) { boolean t = true; // label first first : { // Illegal statement here // as label second is not // introduced yet break second; second : { third : { // Before break System.out.println("Before the break statement"); // break will take the control out of // second label if (t) break second; System.out.println("This won't execute."); } System.out.println("This won't execute."); } // First block System.out.println("This is after second block."); } }}Output: Before the break statement. This is after the second block.Related Articles: Decision making in JavaBreak statement in C++My Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousContinue Statement in JavaNext return keyword in JavaRecommended ArticlesPage :Break and Continue statement in Java02, Sep 20Decision Making in Java (if, if-else, switch, break, continue, jump)15, Mar 17Break Any Outer Nested Loop by Referencing its Name in Java18, Oct 20Usage of Break keyword in Java09, Nov 20Switch Statement in Java15, May 17Unreachable statement using final and non-final variable in Java16, Aug 18Java if-else statement with Examples20, Nov 19Java if statement with Examples20, Nov 19Enhancements for Switch Statement in Java 1323, Oct 20Continue Statement in Java02, Nov 20Java Program to Print any Statement without Using the Main Method16, Nov 20How to Use Callable Statement in Java to Call Stored Procedure?03, Mar 21Import Statement in Java28, Nov 21Difference Between java.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp and java.sql.Date in Java07, Apr 21How to Convert java.sql.Date to java.util.Date in Java?02, Feb 21Different Ways to Convert java.util.Date to java.time.LocalDate in Java05, Jan 21How to Convert java.util.Date to java.sql.Date in Java?23, Mar 21Java.util.BitSet class methods in Java with Examples | Set 218, Nov 16Java.Lang.Float class in Java27, Mar 17Java.io.BufferedInputStream class in Java20, Jan 17Java.io.ObjectInputStream Class in Java | Set 102, Feb 17Java.util.BitSet class in Java with Examples | Set 116, Nov 16Java.io.BufferedWriter class methods in Java29, Dec 16Java.io.DataOutputStream in Java06, Jan 17Article Contributed By :harsh.agarwal0@harsh.agarwal0Vote for difficultyCurrent difficulty : EasyEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertImproved By :SumitBMArticle Tags :JavaPractice Tags :JavaReport IssueWriting code in comment?
