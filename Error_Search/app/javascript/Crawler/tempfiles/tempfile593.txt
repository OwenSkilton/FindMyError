statements.Java while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.Syntax:while (test_expression) { // statements update_expression; }The various parts of the While loop are:Test Expression: In this expression we have to test the condition. If the condition evaluates to true then we will execute the body of the loop and go to update expression. Otherwise, we will exit from the while loop.Example:i <= 10Update Expression: After executing the loop body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value.Example:i++;How does a While loop executes?Control falls into the while loop.The flow jumps to ConditionCondition is tested.If Condition yields true, the flow goes into the Body.If Condition yields false, the flow goes outside the loopThe statements inside the body of the loop get executed.Updation takes place.Control flows back to Step 2.The do-while loop has ended and the flow has gone outside.Flow chart while loop (for Control Flow):Example 1: This program will try to print “Hello World” 5 times.// Java program to illustrate while loop. class whileLoopDemo { public static void main(String args[]) { // initialization expression int i = 1; // test expression while (i < 6) { System.out.println("Hello World"); // update expression i++; } }}Output:Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World Dry-Running Example 1: The program will execute in the following manner.1. Program starts. 2. i is initialized with value 1. 3. Condition is checked. 1 < 6 yields true. 3.a) "Hello World" gets printed 1st time. 3.b) Updation is done. Now i = 2. 4. Condition is checked. 2 < 6 yields true. 4.a) "Hello World" gets printed 2nd time. 4.b) Updation is done. Now i = 3. 5. Condition is checked. 3 < 6 yields true. 5.a) "Hello World" gets printed 3rd time 5.b) Updation is done. Now i = 4. 6. Condition is checked. 4 < 6 yields true. 6.a) "Hello World" gets printed 4th time 6.b) Updation is done. Now i = 5. 7. Condition is checked. 5 < 6 yields true. 7.a) "Hello World" gets printed 5th time 7.b) Updation is done. Now i = 6. 8. Condition is checked. 6 < 6 yields false. 9. Flow goes outside the loop. Program terminates. Example 2: This program will find the summation of numbers from 1 to 10.// Java program to illustrate while loop class whileLoopDemo { public static void main(String args[]) { int x = 1, sum = 0; // Exit when x becomes greater than 4 while (x <= 10) { // summing up x sum = sum + x; // Increment the value of x for // next iteration x++; } System.out.println("Summation: " + sum); }}Output:Summation: 55 Related Articles:Loops in JavaJava For loop with ExamplesJava do-while loop with ExamplesDifference between for and while loop in C, C++, JavaDifference between while and do-while loop in C, C++, JavaMy Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousJava For loop with ExamplesNext Java do-while loop with ExamplesRecommended ArticlesPage :Difference between while and do-while loop in C, C++, Java30, May 19Java do-while loop with Examples20, Nov 19C/C++ while loop with Examples20, Nov 19C/C++ do while loop with Examples20, Nov 19Difference between for and do-while loop in C, C++, Java27, Jun 19Difference between for and while loop in C, C++, Java27, Jun 19Java Program to Find Sum of Natural Numbers Using While Loop01, Dec 20Java Program to Compute the Sum of Numbers in a List Using While-Loop27, Dec 20Java Program to Reverse a Number and find the Sum of its Digits Using do-while Loop16, Nov 20While loop with Compile time constants11, Dec 20Difference Between for loop and Enhanced for loop in Java10, Feb 21How to fix java.lang.ClassCastException while using the TreeMap in Java?18, Jan 21Java Program to Check Array Bounds while Inputing Elements into the Array10, Nov 20How to Maintain Insertion Order While Getting Unique Values from ArrayList in Java?18, Jan 21How to Ignore Unknown Properties While Parsing JSON in Java?14, Apr 21ConcurrentModificationException while using Iterator in Java14, Apr 21How to Avoid TLE While Coding in Java?09, Mar 21Java For loop with Examples20, Nov 19Remove an Entry using key from HashMap while Iterating over it31, Oct 18Remove an Entry using value from HashMap while Iterating over it31, Oct 18Hello World Program : First program while learning Programming25, Nov 19What Factors one should Keep in Mind while doing E-Commerce?01, Aug 21C/C++ For loop with Examples11, Nov 19For-each loop in Java10, Jun 17Article Contributed By :Chinmoy Lenka@Chinmoy LenkaVote for difficultyCurrent difficulty : EasyEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertArticle Tags :JavaSchool ProgrammingPractice Tags :JavaReport IssueWriting code in comment?
