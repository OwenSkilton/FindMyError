Sometimes it is termed as Go Programming Language. It provides a rich standard library, garbage collection, and dynamic-typing capability. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language and mainly used in Google’s production systems. Golang is one of the most trending programming languages among developers.Recent Articles on Golang!Overview, Fundamentals, Control Flow, Functions and Methods, Structure, Arrays & Slices, String, Pointers, Interfaces, Concurrency OverviewIntroduction to GolangInstalling Golang on WindowsInstalling Golang on MacOSHello World! in GolangGolang vs C++Golang vs JavaGolang vs PythonFundamentalsIdentifiers in GolangKeywords in GolangData TypesVariablesConstantsRune in GolangOperators in GolangScope of VariablesType Castingvar Keyword in GolangShort Declaration Operator(:=)var keyword vs short declaration operatorControl StatementsDecision Making StatementsLoops in GolangLoop Control StatementsSwitch Statement in GoDeadlock and Default Case in Select StatementFunctions & MethodsWhat are the Functions?Variadic FunctionAnonymous Functionmain and init functionFunction ArgumentsFunction Returning Multiple ValuesNamed Return ValuesBlank IdentifierDeferMethodsMethods With Same NameStructureStructuresStructure EqualityNested StructureAnonymous Structure and FieldsPromoted Fields in StructurePromoted Methods in StructureFunction as a Field in StructureArrays & SlicesArrays in GolangCopying an Array into Another Array in GolangPassing an Array to a Function in GolangSlices in GolangSlice Composite LiteralCopying one Slice into another SlicePassing a Slice to FunctionComparing two Slices in GolangChecking the Equality of Slices in GolangSorting a Slice in GolangTrimming a Slice in GolangSplitting a Slice in GolangStringStrings in GolangDifferent ways to compare StringsDifferent ways to concatenate two stringsTrimming a String in GolangSplitting a String in GolangCheck if the given characters are present in StringRepeating a String for Specific Number of TimesFinding the index value of specified stringCounting the Number of Repeated Characters in StringPointersPointersPointer to Pointer (Double Pointer)Pointers to a FunctionReturning Pointer from a FunctionPointer to an Array as Function ArgumentPointer to StructComparing PointersFinding the Capacity of the PointerFinding the Length of the PointerInterfacesInterfacesMultiple InterfacesEmbedding InterfacesPolymorphism Using InterfacesConcurrencyGoroutines – ConcurrencySelect StatementMultiple GoroutinesGoroutine vs ThreadChannel in GolangUnidirectional Channel in Golang My Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSaveWriting code in comment?
