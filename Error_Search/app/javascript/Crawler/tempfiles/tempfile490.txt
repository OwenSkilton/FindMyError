In simple mathematics, you can learn about mensuration. The principles of mensuration are discussed here, as are all the essential mensuration formulas. For a better understanding of these ideas, the properties of various geometric forms and the accompanying figures are also shown. Mensuration is a branch of mathematics that deals with the scale, volume, or area of various geometric forms. These forms are available in two or three dimensions.Table of ContentsMensuration of 2D shapesMensuration of 3D shapesMensuration of 2D shapesMensuration is the measuring theory. It is the field of mathematics that is used to measure various figures such as the cube, cuboid, square, rectangle, cylinder, and so on. Mensuration of two-dimensional figures such as area, perimeter, and so on. The form or figure having two dimensions, such as length and breadth, is referred to as a 2-D form. A 2-D figure is something like a square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, trapezium, rhombus, and so on. We can measure 2-D forms using Area (A) and Perimeter (P) as discussed below:Introduction to MensurationArea of TrapeziumArea of PolygonsHeron’s FormulaApplications of Heron’s FormulaArea of 2D ShapesPerimeter of circular figures, Areas of sector and segment of a circle Areas of combination of plane figuresCircleMensuration of 3D shapesMensuration is concerned with the measuring of three-dimensional solids in terms of total surface area, lateral/curved surface area, and volume. 3D figures are those that have more than two dimensions, such as length, breadth, and height. Cube, Cuboid, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, and other three-dimensional forms are examples. Total Surface Area, Lateral Surface Area, Curved Surface Area, and Volume are used to calculate the 3D figure are discussed in the articles below:Surface Area of Cube, Cuboid, and CylinderVolume of Cube, Cuboid, and CylinderVolume and CapacitySurface Area of 3D ShapesVolumes of Cubes and CuboidsSurface Areas and VolumesVolumes of a combination of solidsConversion of solidsFrustum of a ConeSection of a ConeParabolaEllipseHyperbolaIdentifying Conic Sections from their EquationMy Personal Notes arrow_drop_upSave LikePreviousAngular 10 NgPlural DirectiveNext AlgebraRecommended ArticlesPage :Mensuration - Volume of Cube, Cuboid, and Cylinder | Class 8 Maths23, Oct 20Mensuration - Area of General Quadrilateral | Class 8 Maths23, Oct 20Area of Trapezium - Mensuration | Class 8 Maths10, Nov 20Volume and Capacity - Mensuration | Class 8 Maths28, Dec 20Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.417, Nov 20Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.119, Nov 20Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.219, Nov 20Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.321, Nov 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.1 | Set 121, Nov 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volume and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.1 | Set 221, Nov 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.1 | Set 127, Nov 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.1 | Set 227, Nov 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise- 21.2 | Set 228, Nov 20Class 8 RD Sharma - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.3 | Set 125, Dec 20Class 8 RD Sharma - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.3 | Set 225, Dec 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube)- Exercise 21.4 | Set 122, Dec 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.2 | Set 129, Jan 21Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.2 | Set 229, Dec 20Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube)- Exercise 21.4 | Set 225, Dec 20Area of Polygons - Mensuration07, Feb 21Article Contributed By :GeeksforGeeksVote for difficultyEasy Normal Medium Hard ExpertArticle Tags :Class 10Class 11Class 12Class 8Class 9School LearningSchool MathematicsReport IssueWriting code in comment?
