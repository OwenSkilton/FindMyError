tree data structure which has the following properties:The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.Topic :BasicConstruction and ConversionCheck and Smallest/Largest ElementRed Black Tree and Threaded
