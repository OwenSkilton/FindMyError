The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.Topics :Singly Linked ListCircular Linked ListDoubly Linked ListMiscQuick LinksSingly Linked List :Introduction to Linked ListLinked List vs ArrayLinked List InsertionLinked List Deletion (Deleting a given key)Linked List Deletion (Deleting a key at given position)Write a function to delete a Linked ListFind Length of a Linked List (Iterative and Recursive)Search an element in a Linked List (Iterative and Recursive)Write a function to get Nth node in a Linked ListNth node from the end of a Linked ListPrint the middle of a given linked listWrite a function that counts the number of times a given int occurs in a Linked ListDetect loop in a linked listFind length of loop in linked listFunction to check if a singly linked list is palindromeRemove duplicates from a sorted linked listRemove duplicates from an unsorted linked listSwap nodes in a linked list without swapping dataPairwise swap elements of a given linked listMove last element to front of a given Linked ListIntersection of two Sorted Linked ListsIntersection point of two Linked Lists.QuickSort on Singly Linked ListSegregate even and odd nodes in a Linked ListReverse a linked listMore >>Circular Linked List :Circular Linked List Introduction and Applications,Circular Linked List TraversalSplit a Circular Linked List into two halvesSorted insert for circular linked listCheck if a linked list is Circular Linked ListConvert a Binary Tree to a Circular Doubly Link ListCircular Singly Linked List | InsertionDeletion from a Circular Linked ListCircular Queue | Set 2 (Circular Linked List Implementation)Count nodes in Circular linked listJosephus Circle using circular linked listConvert singly linked list into circular linked listCircular Linked List | Set 1 (Introduction and Applications)Circular Linked List | Set 2 (Traversal)Implementation of Deque using circular arrayExchange first and last nodes in Circular Linked ListMore >>Doubly Linked List :Doubly Linked List Introduction and InsertionDelete a node in a Doubly Linked ListReverse a Doubly Linked ListThe Great Tree-List Recursion Problem.Copy a linked list with next and arbit pointerQuickSort on Doubly Linked ListSwap Kth node from beginning with Kth node from end in a Linked ListMerge Sort for Doubly Linked ListCreate a Doubly Linked List from a Ternary TreeFind pairs with given sum in doubly linked listInsert value in sorted way in a sorted doubly linked listDelete a Doubly Linked List node at a given positionCount triplets in a sorted doubly linked list whose sum is equal to a given value xRemove duplicates from a sorted doubly linked listDelete all occurrences of a given key in a doubly linked listRemove duplicates from an unsorted doubly linked listSort the biotonic doubly linked listSort a k sorted doubly linked listConvert a given Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List | SetProgram to find size of Doubly Linked ListSorted insert in a doubly linked list with head and tail pointersLarge number arithmetic using doubly linked listRotate Doubly linked list by N nodesPriority Queue using doubly linked listReverse a doubly linked list in groups of given sizeDoubly Circular Linked List | Set 1 (Introduction and Insertion)Doubly Circular Linked List | Set 2 (Deletion)More >>Misc :Skip List | Set 1 (Introduction)Skip List | Set 2 (Insertion)Skip List | Set 3 (Searching and Deletion)Reverse a stack without using extra space in O(n)An interesting method to print reverse of a linked listLinked List representation of Disjoint Set Data StructuresSublist Search (Search a linked list in another list)How to insert elements in C++ STL List ?Unrolled Linked List | Set 1 (Introduction)A Programmer’s approach of looking at Array vs. Linked ListHow to write C functions that modify head pointer of a Linked List?Given a linked list which is sorted, how will you insert in sorted wayCan we reverse a linked list in less than O(n)?Practice questions for Linked List and RecursionConstruct a Maximum Sum Linked List out of two Sorted Linked Lists having some Common nodesGiven only a pointer to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you delete it?Why Quick Sort preferred for Arrays and Merge Sort for Linked Lists?Squareroot(n)-th node in a Linked ListFind the fractional (or n/k – th) node in linked listFind modular node in a linked listConstruct a linked list from 2D matrixFind smallest and largest elements in singly linked listArrange consonants and vowels nodes in a linked listPartitioning a linked list around a given value and If we don’t care about making the elements of the list “stable”Modify contents of Linked ListQuick Links :‘Practice Problems’ on Linked List‘Videos’ on Linked List‘Quizzes’ on Linked ListGeeksforgeeks Courses:1.
