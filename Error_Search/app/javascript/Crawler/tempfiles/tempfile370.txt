For example, output of following program is:Base Class Constructor Called Derived Class Constructor Called Java// filename: Main.javaclass Base { Base() { System.out.println("Base Class Constructor Called "); }} class Derived extends Base { Derived() { System.out.println("Derived Class Constructor Called "); }} public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Derived d = new Derived(); }}But, if we want to call parameterized constructor of base class, then we can call it using super(). The point to note is base class constructor call must be the first line in derived class constructor. For example, in the following program, super(_x) is first line derived class constructor. Java// filename: Main.javaclass Base { int x; Base(int _x) { x = _x; }} class Derived extends Base { int y; Derived(int _x, int _y) { super(_x); y = _y; } void Display() { System.out.println("x = "+x+", y = "+y); }} public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Derived d = new Derived(10, 20); d.Display(); }}Output: x = 10, y = 20Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.
