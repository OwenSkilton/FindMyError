The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.There are three types of CSS which are given below:InlineInternal or EmbeddedExternalWhy we learn CSS?Styling is the essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.Base for web development: HTML and CSS is the basic skill that every web developer should know. It is the basic skill that is required for building a website.Makes your website look attractive: A website that’s dull and plain will not attract the user most probably, so adding some style would surely make your website presentable to the user.Makes the design come live: A web developer is responsible for making the design given to him as a live product. It is used for styling to develop the design of the website.Increases user experience of website: A website with a simple yet beautiful UI would help the users to go through the website easily. It is used to make the user interface better.More career opportunities: Since CSS is a basic requirement while learning Web Development, therefor there are abundant career opportunities for it. As a freelancer too you can land up to many projects. Basic Format: It is the basic structure of HTML webpage and we use CSS style inside webpage. In a web page, we use internal CSS (i.e. adding CSS code inside <head> tag of HTML code).<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <!-- Head section of web page --> <title></title> <!-- Stylesheet of web page --> <style></style> </head> <body> <!-- Body section of web page --> </body> </html> Example: Let’s see a small example of HTML webpage with CSS styles. Here, we use styles to set the alignment and text color of a webpage.<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title> Simple webpage </title> <!-- Stylesheet of web page --> <style> body { text-align: center; } h1 { color: green; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome to GeeksforGeeks</h1> <p>A computer science portal for geeks</p> </body> </html> Output:Learn more about HTML:IntroductionWebsite LayoutTop 10 Projects For Beginners To Practice HTML and CSS SkillsDesign GeeksforGeeks logoMeet the Team Page DesignTribute Page DesignDesign a web pageContact us Page DesignCreate Browsers WindowCreate an Email NewsletterComplete References:Basics Complete ReferenceProperties Complete ReferenceSelectors Complete ReferenceFunctions Complete ReferenceQuestions Complete ReferenceExamples: Please go through this link to see the wide collection of programming examples.
