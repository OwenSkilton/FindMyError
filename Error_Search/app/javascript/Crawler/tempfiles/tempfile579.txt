In this section, we’ll look at the relationship between the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. The fundamentals of trigonometry describe three main functions: sine, cosine, and tangent.Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that uses trigonometric ratios to determine the angles and incomplete sides of a triangle. Angles are measured in either radians or degrees. Angles in trigonometry that are widely used are 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°.Table of ContentsBasic TrigonometryInverse TrigonometryApplications of TrigonometryBasic TrigonometryBasic Trigonometry covers, tangent, sine, and cosine are the names given to the three ratios. It can then be expanded to include other ratios and trigonometry in the Cartesian Plane. These trigonometry studies will cover the following topics: Trigonometry in the Cartesian Plane, Graphs of Trigonometric Functions, and Trigonometric Identities are all topics covered in this course. Following are the articles that covers all the topics in the same: Introduction to Trigonometric Ratios of a TriangleTrigonometric Ratios of Some Specific AnglesReciprocal of Trigonometric RatiosTrigonometric IdentitiesTrigonometric FunctionsInverse TrigonometryInverse trigonometric functions are essentially the inverse functions of the fundamental trigonometric functions sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant. These functions are also known as arcs functions, anti-trigonometric functions, and cyclometer functions. These trigonometry inverse functions are used to calculate the angle for each of the trigonometry ratios. In physics, mechanics, geometry, and navigation, inverse trigonometry functions are widely used as:Basic ConceptsGraphs of Inverse Trigonometric FunctionsProperties of Inverse Trigonometric FunctionsApplications of TrigonometryTrigonometry is used to calculate the height of a structure or a mountain. Using trigonometric functions, the distance of a structure from the perspective and the elevation angle can easily calculate the height of a building. It does not have particular applications in solving functional problems, but it is used in a variety of fields. For example, trigonometry is used in the development of computer music: as you might know, sound moves in the form of waves, and this wave pattern is used in the development of computer music by passing it through a sine or cosine function.
